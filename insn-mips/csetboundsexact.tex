\subsection*{CSetBoundsExact: Set Bounds Exactly}

\subsubsection*{Format}

CSetBoundsExact cd, cb, rt

\begin{center}
\cherithreeop[header]{0x9}{cd}{cb}{rt}
\end{center}

\subsubsection*{Description}

Capability register \emph{cd} is replaced with a capability with its \cbase{}
replaced with \emph{cb}.\cbase{} $+$ \emph{cb}.\coffset{}, \clength{} set to
\emph{rt}, and \coffset{} set to zero.
When capability compression is in use, an exception is thrown if the requested
bounds cannot be represented exactly.

\subsubsection*{Semantics}
\sailMIPScode{CSetBoundsExact}

An exception cannot occur if the requested bounds have been suitably aligned
and padded using the \insnmipsref{CRAM} and \insnmipsref{CRRL} instructions.
If looser bounds, rather than exception, are desired, then it may be
preferable to use \insnmipsref{CSetBounds}.

\subsubsection*{Exceptions}

A coprocessor 2 exception is raised if:

\begin{itemize}
\item
\cchecktag{}
\item
\emph{cb} is sealed.
\item
\emph{cursor} $<$ \emph{cb}.\cbase{}
\item
\emph{cursor} $+$ \emph{rt} $>$ \emph{cb}.\cbase{} $+$ cb.\clength{}
\item
The requested bounds cannot be represented exactly.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Notes}

\begin{itemize}
\item
In the above Sail code, arithmetic is over the mathematical integers and
\emph{rt} is unsigned, so a large value of \emph{rt} cannot cause
\emph{cursor} $+$ \emph{rt} to wrap around and be less than \emph{cb}.\cbase{}.
Implementations (that, for example, will probably use a fixed number of
bits to store values) must handle this overflow case correctly.
\end{itemize}
