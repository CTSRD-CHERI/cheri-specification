\subsubsection*{Description}

Move the architectural Compartment ID (CID) to integer register \emph{rd},
retrieving the last value set by \insnmipsref{CSetCID}.

\subsubsection*{Semantics}

\sailMIPScode{CGetCID}

\subsubsection*{Exceptions}

This instruction does not raise any exceptions.

\subsubsection*{Notes}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  We choose not to require any additional privilege to query the CID.
  An argument could be made that this is an information leak.
  If so, one possible design choice would be to require
  Access\_System\_Registers to retrieve the value of the CID; however, this
  would be inconsistent with the access-control model for setting the CID.
\item
  While this instruction has been introduced for debugging purposes, it could
  also have utility in indexing state -- e.g., to implement concepts such as
  compartment-local storage.
\end{itemize}
