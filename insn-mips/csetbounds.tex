\subsection*{CSetBounds: Set Bounds}

\subsubsection*{Format}

CSetBounds cd, cb, rt

\begin{center}
\cherithreeop[header]{0x8}{cd}{cb}{rt}
\end{center}

\subsubsection*{Description}

Capability register \emph{cd} is replaced with a capability that:

\begin{itemize}
\item
Grants access to a subset of the addresses authorized by \emph{cb}.
That is, \emph{cd}.\cbase{} $\ge$ \emph{cb}.\cbase{} and
\emph{cd}.\cbase{} $+$ \emph{cd}.\clength{} $\le$ \emph{cb}.\cbase{} $+$
\emph{cb}.\clength{}.
\item
Grants access to at least the addresses \emph{cb}.\cbase{} $+$
\emph{cb}.\coffset{} $\ldots$ \emph{cb}.\cbase{} $+$ \emph{cb}.\coffset{}
$+$ \emph{rt} $-$ 1.
That is, \emph{cd}.\cbase{} $\le$ \emph{cb}.\cbase{}
$+$ \emph{cb}.\coffset{} and \emph{cd}.\cbase{} $+$ \emph{cd}.\clength{}
$\ge$ \emph{cb}.\cbase{} $+$ \emph{cb}.\coffset{} $+$ \emph{rt}.
\item
Has an \coffset{} that points to the same memory location as \emph{cb}'s
\coffset{}.
That is, \emph{cd}.\coffset{} = \emph{cb}.\coffset{} + \emph{cb}.\cbase{} -
\emph{cd}.\cbase{}.
\item
Has the same \cperms{} as \emph{cb}, that is, \emph{cd}.\cperms{} = \emph{cb}.\cperms{}.
\end{itemize}

%When the hardware uses a 256-bit representation for capabilities, the bounds
%of the destination capability \emph{cd} are exactly as requested.
With compressed capabilities, not all combinations of \cbase{} and \clength{}
are representable.
\emph{cd} may therefore grant access to a range of memory addresses that is
wider than requested, but is still guaranteed to be within the bounds of
\emph{cb}.
\rwnote{Check that the following statement is true.}
This cannot occur if the requested bounds have been suitably aligned and
padded using the \insnmipsref{CRAM} and \insnmipsref{CRRL} instructions.
If software is not guaranteed to provide suitable alignment and padding, it
may be desirable to use \insnmipsref{CSetBoundsExact} so that an exception will
be thrown the requested bounds cannot be represented.

\subsubsection*{Semantics}

\sailMIPScode{CSetBounds}

\subsubsection*{Exceptions}

A coprocessor 2 exception is raised if:

\begin{itemize}
\item
\cchecktag{}
\item
\emph{cb} is sealed.
\item
\emph{cursor} $<$ \emph{cb}.\cbase{}
\item
\emph{cursor} $+$ \emph{rt} $>$ \emph{cb}.\cbase{} $+$ cb.\clength{}
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Notes}

\begin{itemize}
\item
In the above Sail code, arithmetic is over the mathematical integers and
\emph{rt} is unsigned, so a large value of \emph{rt} cannot cause
\emph{cursor} $+$ \emph{rt} to wrap around and be less than \emph{cb}.\cbase{}.
Implementations (that, for example, will probably use a fixed number of
bits to store values) must handle this overflow case correctly.
\end{itemize}
