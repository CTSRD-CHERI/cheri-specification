\subsection*{CSeal: Seal a Capability}

\subsubsection*{Format}

CSeal cd, cs, ct

\begin{center}
\cherithreeop[header]{0xb}{cd}{cs}{ct}
\end{center}

\subsubsection*{Description}

Capability register \emph{cs} is sealed
\psnote{it's confusing phrasing to say the \emph{register} itself is sealed, as
opposed to the value the register. Instead, perhaps ``The capability
 in register \emph{cs} is sealed''?  I guess this idiom may occur in
 many places, so I've not just fixed this one. Robert N-W?}
 with an \cotype{} of
\emph{ct}.\cbase{} $+$ \emph{ct}.\coffset{}
and the result is placed in \emph{cd}:

\begin{itemize}
\item
\emph{cd}.\cotype{} is set to \emph{ct}.\cbase{} + \emph{ct}.\coffset{};
\item
\emph{cd} is sealed;
\item
and the other fields of \emph{cd} are copied from \emph{cs}.
\end{itemize}

\emph{ct} must grant \emph{Permit\_Seal} permission, and the new \cotype{}
of \emph{cd} must be between \emph{ct}.\cbase{} and \emph{ct}.\cbase{} $+$
\emph{ct}.\clength{} $-$ 1.

\subsubsection*{Exceptions}

A coprocessor 2 exception is raised if:

\begin{itemize}
\item
\emph{cs}.\ctag{} is not set.
\item
\emph{ct}.\ctag{} is not set.
\item
\emph{cs} is sealed.
\item
\emph{ct} is sealed.
\item
\emph{ct}.\cperms.\emph{Permit\_Seal} is not set.
% \item
% \emph{ct}.\cperms.\emph{Permit\_Execute} is not set.
\item
\emph{ct}.\coffset{} $\ge$ \emph{ct}.length{}
\item
\emph{ct}.\cbase{} $+$ \emph{ct}.\coffset{} $> \emph{max\_otype}$
\item
The bounds of \emph{cb} cannot be represented exactly in a sealed capability.
\end{itemize}
