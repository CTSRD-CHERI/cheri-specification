\subsubsection*{Notes}

\begin{itemize}
\item This instruction may be useful when C is using the lower bits of a pointer with known alignment to store additional metadata.
\item This instruction is also useful when using a capability type as a union of pointers, integers and floating pointer numbers using a NaN-boxing representation.
\item In a merged register file this instruction would not be necessary since the integer bitwise and could be used instead.
\end{itemize}
