\chapter{Mapping CHERI Protection into Architecture}
\label{chap:architecture}

%\rwnote{This chapter has been largely rearranged, but requires substantial
%  editing to tidy up the results, shift some contents to/from
%  architecture-specific chapters, and to update the introduction and first few
%  sections.  It would be nice to add a section on ensuring that both the base
%  ISA and our extensions consistently enforce CHERI's invariants/safety
%  properties -- e.g., provenance validity, monotonicity, etc.}

In this chapter, we explore architecture-neutral aspects of the mapping from
the abstract CHERI protection model into Instruction-Set Architectures (ISAs).
We consider the high-level architectural goals in mappings and the
implications of our specific capability-system model before turning to the
concrete definitions associated with CHERI's architectural capabilities,
register files, tagged memory, and its composition with various existing
architectural features such as exception handling and virtual memory.

We conclude with a consideration of ``deep'' versus ``surface'' design
choices: where there is freedom to make different choices in instantiating
the CHERI model in a specific ISA, with an eye towards both the adaptation
design space and also applications to further non-MIPS ISAs, and where
divergence might lead to protection inconsistency across architectures.

\section{Architectural Instantiations of CHERI Protection}

Our current instantiations within concrete ISAs are:

\begin{description}
\item[CHERI-RISC-V] is our mature reference instantiation.
  It is an instantiation of the CHERI protection model against 32-bit and
  64-bit RISC-V (Chapter~\ref{chap:cheri-riscv}).

  CHERI-RISC-V has been validated with a complete end-to-end hardware-software
  stack including a formal ISA model, ISA-level simulations, three FPGA
  implementations, adaptations of our CheriBSD and CheriFreeRTOS operating
  systems, Clang/LLVM/LLD toolchain, GDB debugger, and application suite.

  We expect continuing disruptive modification to this ISA mapping, including
  reencoding of many key instructions, as it transitions to a more mature
  status.

\item[Arm Morello] is an experimental instantiation created by Arm
  in collaboration with the CHERI team~\cite{arm-morello}.
  It is an instantiation of the CHERI protection model against the 64-bit
  ARMv8-A ISA.
  % (Chapter~\ref{chap:morello}).
  \rwnote{Need a Morello chapter.}

  Morello is the target of an in-progress CPU, SoC, and board design based on
  Arm's Neoverse N1 system architecture, and has been validated for much of
  the end-to-end- hardware-stack including a formal ISA model, ISA-level
  simulations, an adaptation of our CheriBSD operating system, Clang/LLVM/LLD
  toolchain, GDB debugger, and application suite.

\item[CHERI-x86-64] is a sketch instantiation intended to describe
  a potential approach to applying the CHERI protection model to the x86-64
  ISA -- the dominant non-RISC architecture (Chapter~\ref{chap:cheri-x86-64}).
\end{description}

\section{High-Level Architectural Goals}

In addition to the broad abstract goal of supporting pointer-centric
protection with strong compatibility and performance objectives, we have
pursued the following architectural goals in integrating CHERI into
contemporary instruction-set architectures:

\begin{enumerate}

\item When mapping the CHERI model into RISC architectures, CHERI's extensions
  should subscribe to the RISC design philosophy: a load-store instruction set
  intended to be targeted by compilers, with more complex instructions
  motivated by quantitative analysis.
  While current page-table structures
  are retained for functionality and compatibility, new
  table-oriented structures are avoided in describing new security primitives.
  In general, instructions that do not access memory or trigger an exception
  should be single-cycle register-to-register operations.

\item New primitives, such as tagged memory and capabilities, are aligned
  closely with current microarchitectural designs (e.g., as relates to
  register files, pipelined and superscalar processors, memory subsystems, and
  buses), offering minimal disruption necessary to offer substantial semantic
  and performance improvements that would be difficult to support with
  current architectures.
  Where current de-facto approaches to microarchitecture must be changed to
  support CHERI -- such as through the adoption of architectural tagged memory
  -- there are efficient implementations.

\item CHERI composes sensibly with MMU-based memory protection: current
  MMU-based operating systems should run unmodified on CHERI designs, and as
  CHERI support is introduced in an MMU-based operating system, it should
  compose naturally while allowing both capability-aware and legacy programs
  to run side-by-side.
  This allows software designers to view the system as a set of more
  conventional virtual address spaces within which CHERI offers protection --
  or as a single-address-space system environment as use of the MMU is
  minimized.

\item As protection pressure shifts from conventional MMU-based techniques to
  reference-oriented protection using CHERI capabilities, page-table
  efficiency increases as larger page sizes cease to penalize protection.

\item Protection primitive use is common-case, not exceptional, and occurs
  in performance-centric code paths such as stack and heap
  allocation, on pointer arithmetic, and on pointer-relative load and store,
  rather than being an infrequent higher-cost activity that can be amortized.

\item The principles of least privilege and intentional use dictate a number
  of aspects of CHERI ISA design, including requiring that no confusion arise
  between the use of capabilities as pointers versus integers as pointers.
  Load, store, and jump instructions will never automatically select
  semantics based on presence of a tag -- for example, to avoid opportunities
  accidental use of the wrong right (e.g., by virtue of a capability tag being
  cleared due to an exploitable software vulnerability leading to its
  interpretation as an integer virtual address).
  Similarly, associative lookups of capabilities are entirely avoided.

  Trade-offs around this design goal inevitably exist.
  For example, to run unmodified software, CHERI provides a Default Data
  Capability that is transparently dereferenced when legacy
  integer-pointer-based code accesses memory, which we deem necessary for
  compatibility reasons.
  Similarly, we do not currently choose to provide granular control over the
  use of ring-based processor privilege, in order to avoid the complexity and
  disruption of implementing entirely new interfaces for interrupt and MMU
  management, using a single permission on code capabilities rather than a
  broad set of possible capabilities representing different privileges.
  A purer (non-hybridized) capability-system design would avoid these
  design choices.

\item Just as C-language pointers map cleanly and efficiently into integers
  today, pointers must similarly map cleanly, efficiently, and vastly more
  robustly, into capabilities.
  This should apply both to language-visible data and code pointers, but also
  pointers used in implementing language features, such as references to
  C++ vtables, return addresses, etc.

\item Flexibility exists to employ only legacy integer pointers or
  capabilities as dictated by software design and code generation, trading off
  compatibility, protection, and performance -- while ensuring that security
  properties are consistently enforced and can be reasoned about cleanly.

\item When used to implement isolation and controlled communication in support
  of compartmentalization, CHERI's communication primitives scale with the
  actual data footprint (i.e., the working set of the application).
  Among other things, this implies that communication should not require
  memory copying costs that grow with data size, nor trigger TLB aliasing
  that increases costs as the degree of sharing increases.
  Our performance goal is to support at least two orders of magnitude more
  active protection domains per core than current MMU-based systems support
  (going from tens or hundreds to at least tens of thousands of domains), and
  similarly to reduce effective domain-crossing cost by at least two orders of
  magnitude.

\item When sharing memory or object references between protection domains,
  programmers should see a unified namespace connoting efficient and
  comprehensible delegation.

\item When implementing efficient protection-domain switching, the
  architecture supports a broad range of software-defined policies, calling
  conventions, and memory models.
  Where possible, software TCB paths should be avoided -- but where necessary
  for semantic flexibility, they should be supported safely and efficiently.
  As with MMU-based protection-domain representation and crossing, CHERI
  supports both synchronous and asynchronous communication patterns.

\item Where possible, we make use of provable, deterministic protection,
  avoiding probabilistic techniques or the use of architectural or
  microarchitectural secrets subject to leaking or side-channel attacks.
  For example, we avoid the use of cryptographic hashes, random address-space
  bits, and version numbers that must be truncated to small numbers of bits
  within a pointer or capability, instead making use of tagging.
  This offers resistance to attacks at stastical scale (e.g., millions of
  devices), and also protects software structures that might otherwise reuse
  secrets allowing multiple attempts (e.g., forked daemon or zygote
  processes).
  Tags allow strong non-reinjection properties: pointers leaked via network
  communications or IPC cannot be reinjected, despite having previously been
  valid.
  This in turn allows stronger temporal safety properties to be enforced by
  software, due to having stronger guarantees.
  Provability is an essential aspect to our work: CHERI's architectural
  safety properties must be formally expressible, deterministically true, and
  mechanically provable from that expression.

\item More generally, we seek to exploit hardware performance gains wherever
  possible: in eliminating repeated software-generated checks by providing
  richer semantics, in providing stronger underlying atomicity for pointer
  integrity protection that would be very difficult to provide on current
  architectures, and in providing more scalable models for memory sharing
  between mutually distrusting software components.
  By making these operations more efficient, we encourage their more extensive
  use.

\end{enumerate}

These and other design goals permeate CHERI's abstract architecture-neutral
design as well as its architecture-specific instantiations.

\section{Capability-System Model}

In CHERI, capabilities are unforgeable tokens of authority through which
programs access all memory and services within an address space.
Capabilities are a fundamental hardware type that may be held in registers
(where they can be inspected, manipulated, and dereferenced using capability
instructions), or in memory (where their integrity is protected).
They include an integer virtual address, bounds, permissions, and other
protective metadata including an object type and one-bit tag.

\textit{Capability permissions} determine what operations (if any) are
available via the architecture.
Commonly used permissions include those authorizing memory loads, memory
stores, and instruction fetches.
Where permissions authorize memory access, \textit{capability bounds} limit
the range of addresses that may be accessed; for other permissions, bounds
constrain other forms of access (e.g., use of the object-type space).
Memory capabilities (those authorizing memory access) may be used to load
other capabilities into registers for use.
Capabilities may also be sealed in order to make their fields immutable and
the capability non-dereferenceable.

While motivated by the goal of representing pointers (protected virtual
addresses), they are also able to protect non-pointer values.
For example, \textit{sealed capabilities} without memory-access permissions
may be used to represent references to protection domains that can be
transitioned to via software-defined object invocation.

\textit{Unforgeability} is implemented by two means: tag bits and guarded
manipulation.
Each capability register (and each capability-aligned physical memory
location) is associated with a tag bit indicating that a capability is valid.
Attempts to directly overwrite a capability in memory using data (rather than
capability) stores automatically clears the tag bit.
When data is loaded into a register, its tag bit is also loaded; while data
without a valid tag can be loaded into a register, attempts to dereference or
invoke such a register will trigger an exception.

\textit{Guarded manipulation} is enforced by virtue of the ISA: instructions
that manipulate capability register fields (e.g., base, offset, length,
permissions, type) are not able to increase the rights associated with a
capability.
Similarly, sealed capabilities can be unsealed only via the invocation
mechanism, or via the unseal instruction subject to similar monotonicity
rules.
This enforces encapsulation, and prevents unauthorized access to the internal
state of objects.

Collectively, unforgeability and guarded manipulation ensure that
dereferenceable capabilities (those with their tag set) have \textit{valid
provenance}: they are derived only from other valid capabilities, and only
through valid manipulations.
All other capabilities will not have their tag set, hence cannot be
dereferenced.

\textit{Intentionality} avoids the automatic selection of a capability from
among a set in order to locate rights to authorize a requested operation.
It is always clear for every instruction what capability will authorize its
action,
e.g.,
whether
for the executing code capability (to authorize privileged ISA
operations such as MMU management), explicit operand capabilities (to query,
modify, or dereference), or implicit use of the Default Data Capability (e.g.,
when constraining legacy load and store instructions).
There are no associative lookups of capabilities to select from among several
options, and instructions are always clearly defined as expecting an integer
or a tagged capability as an operand, failing if that expectation is not met.

We anticipate that many languages will expose capabilities to the programmer
via pointers or references -- e.g., as qualified pointers in C, or mapped from
object references in Java.
Similarly, capabilities may be used to bridge communication between different
languages more safely -- for example, by imposing Java memory-protection and
security properties on native code compiled against the Java Native Interface
(JNI).
In general, we expect that languages will not expose registers directly for
management by programmers, instead using them for instruction operands and as
a cache of active values, as is the case for integer pointers today.
On the other hand, we expect that there will be some programmers using the
equivalent of assembly-language operations, and the CHERI compartmentalization
model does not place trust in compiler correctness for non-TCB code.

\section{Architectural Capabilities}
\label{section:architectural-capabilities}

\textit{CHERI capabilities} are an architectural data type, directly
implemented by the CPU hardware in a manner similar to integers or
floating-point values.
Capabilities may be held in registers or in tagged memory.
On RISC (``load-store'') architectures, CHERI-aware code can use new
capability instructions to inspect, manipulate, and dereference capabilities
held in registers.
On CISC architectures, direct use of capabilities in memory may also be
possible.
In-register modification of capability values is subject to guarded
manipulation (e.g., to enforce monotonicity), and dereference is subject to
appropriate checks (e.g., for a valid tag, sealing, appropriate permissions,
and suitable bounds).
In-memory modification of capability values is protected by tagged memory.

\subsection{Address Size and Capability Size}

Architectural capabilities are sized with respect to the address size of the
architecture.
As we define CHERI capability variants for both 32-bit architectures and
64-bit architectures, we parameterize the definitions in this chapter as
follows:

\begin{description}
\item[XLEN] is the architectural address size in bits.
  For 32-bit architectures, \xlen{} is 32.
  For 64-bit architectures, \xlen{} is 64.

\item[CLEN] is the architectural capability size in bits, which is 2$\times$
  the architectural address size (and does not include the tag bit).
  For 32-bit architectures, \clen{} is 64.
  For 64-bit architectures, \clen{} is 128.
\end{description}

\subsection{Capability Contents}

Capabilities contain a number of software-accessible architectural fields,
which may differ in content and size from the microarchitectural
implementation or that is apparent from its in-memory representation:

\begin{itemize}
\item
Tag bit (``\ctag{}'', 1 bit ``out of band'' from addressable memory)
\item
Permissions mask (``\cperms{}'', parameterizable size)
\item
Software-defined permissions mask (``\cuperms{}'', parameterizable size)
\item
Flags (``\cflags{}'', parameterizable size)
\item
Object type (``\cotype{}'', 4 bits for 64-bit capabilities or 18 bits for
  128-bit capabilities)
\item
Offset (``\coffset{}'', \xlen{})
\item
Base virtual address (``\cbase{}'', \xlen{})
\item
Length in bytes (``\clength{}'', \xlen{})
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Tag Bit}

The \ctag{} bit indicates whether an in-register capability or a
capability-sized, capability-aligned location in physical memory contains a
valid capability.
If \ctag{} is set, the capability is valid and can be dereferenced (subject to
other checks).
If \ctag{} is clear, the capability is invalid, and cannot be dereferenced.
Section~\ref{sec:tagged-memory} describes the behavior of tagged memory.

% \subsubsection{Sealed Bit}
%
% The \csealed{} flag indicates whether a capability is usable for
% general-purpose capability operations.
% If this flag is set, the capability is sealed, causing it to become
% non-dereferenceable (i.e., cannot be used for load, store, or instruction
% fetch) and immutable (i.e., whose fields cannot be manipulated).
% Capabilities are sealed with an object type (see
% Section~\ref{section:object-type}); the sealed bit may be removed using only
% the \insnref{CUnseal} or \insnref{Cinvoke} instructions (see
% Section~\ref{section:protection-domain-transition-with-cinvoke}).
% One potential application of sealed capabilities is for use as
% object-capability references -- i.e., as references to software-defined
% objects with architecturally enforced encapsulation.
% However, they are available to software for more general use in constructing
% architecturally protected references.

\subsubsection{Permission Bits}
\label{sect:capability-permission-bits}

The \cperms{} bit vector governs the architecturally defined permissions of
the capability including read, write, and execute
permissions.\footnote{Although these values are used in
CHERI-RISC-V, the specific integer constants -- and in some cases the named
permissions -- differ in Arm's Morello.}
Bits 0--11 of this field, which control use and propagation of the
capability, and also limit access to privileged instructions, are defined in
Table~\ref{table:capability-permission-bits}.
Permissions grant access only subject to constraints imposed by the current
architectural ring -- that is, they always restrict relative to the existing
architectural security model.
Permissions are also contingent on the capability \ctag{} bit being set, and
specific permissions may depend on the capability being sealed (or unsealed), or
bounds checks against \cbase{} and \clength{}, when used:

\begin{table}
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{llcll}
\toprule
Bit & Name		& Tag?		& Seal?		& Bounds? \\
\midrule
0 & \cappermG		& \checkmark	& -		& - \\
1 & \cappermX		& \checkmark	& Unsealed	& Address\\
2 & \cappermL		& \checkmark	& Unsealed	& Address\\
3 & \cappermS		& \checkmark	& Unsealed	& Address\\
4 & \cappermLC		& \checkmark	& Unsealed 	& - \\
5 & \cappermSC		& \checkmark	& Unsealed	& - \\
6 & \cappermSLC		& \checkmark	& Unsealed	& - \\
7 & \cappermSeal	& \checkmark	& Unsealed	& Object Type \\
8 & \cappermCInvoke	& \checkmark	& Sealed	& - \\
9 & \cappermUnseal	& \checkmark	& Unsealed	& Object Type \\
10 & \cappermASR	& \checkmark	& Unsealed	& - \\
11 & \cappermCid	& \checkmark	& Unsealed	& CID \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
\caption{Architectural permission bits for the \cperms{} capability field,
  along with checks usually used alongside that permission: \textit{Tag?}
  Require a valid tag; \textit{Seal?} Require the capability to be sealed or
  unsealed; \textit{Bounds?} Perform a bounds check authorizing access to
  the listed namespace.
  See the instruction-set reference for detailed per-instruction
  requirements.}
\label{table:capability-permission-bits}
\end{table}

\begin{description}
\item[\cappermG] Allow this capability to be stored via capabilities that do not themselves have \\ \cappermSLC set.

\item[\cappermX] Allow this capability to be used in the \PCC{} register as a capability for the program counter, constraining control flow.

\item[\cappermL] Allow this capability to be used to load untagged data; also requires \\ \cappermLC to permit loading a tagged value.

\item[\cappermS] Allow this capability to be used to store untagged data; also requires \\ \cappermSC to permit storing a tagged value.

\item[\cappermLC] Allow this capability to be used to load capabilities with valid tags; \cappermL is also required.

\item[\cappermSC] Allow this capability to be used to store capabilities with valid tags; the permission \cappermS is also required.

\item[\cappermSLC] Allow this capability to be used to store non-global capabilities; also requires \cappermS and \cappermSC.

\item[\cappermSeal] Allow this capability to authorize the sealing of another capability with a \cotype{} equal to this capability's \cbase{} $+$ \coffset{}.

\item[\cappermCInvoke] Allow this sealed capability to be used with \insnref{CInvoke}.

\item[\cappermUnseal] Allow this capability to be used to unseal another capability with a \cotype{} equal to this capability's \cbase{} $+$ \coffset{}.

\item[\cappermCid] Allow the architectural compartment ID to be set to this capability's \cbase{} $+$ \coffset{} using \insnref{CSetCID}.
\end{description}

In general, permissions on a capability relate to its implicit or explicit
use in authorizing an operation that uses the capability -- e.g., in fetching
an instruction via \PCC{}, branching to a code capability, loading or storing
data via a capability, loading or storing a capability via a capability,
performing sealing or unsealing operations, or controlling capability
propagation.
In addition, a further \textit{privileged permission} controls access to
privileged aspects of the instruction set such as exception-handling, which
are key to the security of the model and yet do not fit the ``capability as an
operand'' model:

\begin{description}
\item[\cappermASR*] Allows access to privileged processor
  permitted by the architecture (e.g., by virtue of being in supervisor mode),
  with architecture-specific implications.
  This bit limits access to features such as MMU manipulation, interrupt
  management, processor reset, and so on.
  The operating system can remove this permission to implement constrained
  compartments within the kernel.
\end{description}

A richer conversion to a capability architecture might replace existing
privileged instructions (e.g., to flush the TLB) with new instructions that
accept an authorizing capability as an operand, and adopt a more granular
model for authorizing architectural privileges using capabilities than this
all-or-nothing approach.

The \cappermSLC permission bit is used to limit
capability propagation via software-defined policies: local capabilities
(i.e., those without the \cappermG permission set) can be stored only via
capabilities that have \cappermSLC set.
Normally, this permission will be set only on capabilities that, themselves,
have the \cappermG bit cleared.
This allows higher-level, software-defined policies, such as ``Disallow storing stack references to heap memory'' or ``Disallow passing local capabilities via cross-domain procedure calls,'' to be implemented.
We anticipate both generalizing and extending this model in the future in
order to support more complex policies -- e.g., relating to the propagation of
garbage-collected pointers, or pointers to volatile vs. non-volatile memory.

\subsubsection{Software-Defined Permission Bits}

The \cuperms{} bit vector may be used by the kernel or application programs
for software-defined permissions.
They can be masked and retrieved using the same \insnref{CAndPerm} and
\insnref{CGetPerm} instructions that operate on hardware-defined
permissions.
We define 0 software-defined permission bits for 64-bit capabilities, and 4
software-defined permission bits for 128-bit capabilities.

Software-defined permission bits can be used in combination with existing
hardware-defined permissions (e.g., to annotate code or data capabilities
with further software-defined rights), or in isolation of them (with all
hardware-defined permissions cleared, giving the capability only
software-defined functionality).
For example, software-defined permissions on code capabilities could be
employed by a userspace runtime to allow the kernel to determine whether a
particular piece of user code is authorized to perform system calls.
Similarly, user permissions on sealed data capabilities might authorize use of
specific methods (or sets of methods) on object capabilities, allowing
different references to objects to authorize different software-defined
behaviors.
Capabilities with all hardware-defined permission bits cleared have only
software-defined interpretations, making them suitable for potential use as
unforgeable tokens of authority authorizing use of in-application or kernel
services.

\subsubsection{Flags}
\label{sec:arch-flags}

The \cflags{} field can be read with the \insnref{CGetFlags} instruction
and written with the \insnref{CSetFlags} instruction.

There are no architecture-neutral flags currently defined, therefore the size and
interpretation of this field are entirely architecture specific.

\subsubsection{Object Type}
\label{section:object-type}

\begin{table}
\begin{center}\begin{tabular}{r|l}
  \cotype{} value & Interpretation \\
  \hline\hline
  $2^{\xlen{}} - 1$ & Unsealed capability \\
  \hline
  $2^{\xlen{}} - 2$ & Sealed entry (``sentry'') capabilities; see \cref{sec:arch-sentry} \\
  \hline
  $2^{\xlen{}} - 3$ & Reserved (experimental ``memory type tokens''; see \cref{app:exp:typetoken}) \\
  \hline
  $2^{\xlen{}} - 4$ & Reserved (experimental ``indirect enter capabilities''; see \cref{app:exp:indsentry}) \\
  \hline
  $2^{\xlen{}} - 5$ & Reserved \\
  through & \\
  $2^{\xlen{}} - 16$ & \\
  \hline
  other & Capability sealed by \insnref{CSeal} \\
\end{tabular}\end{center}
%
\caption{Object types and their architecture-specified roles.}
\label{tab:archotypes}
%
\end{table}

The \cotype{} field is 4 bits for 64-bit capabilities, and 18 bits for 128-bit
capabilities.
The field indicates whether a capability is sealed and, if so,
what ``type'' it has; see \cref{tab:archotypes} for defined values.
CHERI uses multiple object types to allow software to create unforgeable
associations between sealed capabilities.
The implementation values in \cotype{} fields are translated to the abstract
space as if by sign extension.  Attempts to seal capabilities to types that
cannot be expressed by the implementation will fail in an
implementation-specified way, but generally similarly to any other
representability failure.
%
If a capability is sealed, it becomes non-dereferenceable (i.e., cannot be used
for load, store, or instruction fetch) and immutable (i.e., whose fields cannot
be manipulated).  Capability unsealing is mediated either by capabilities (via
the \insnref{CUnseal} instruction) or by control transfers (via
the \insnref{CInvoke} instruction, as in
\cref{section:protection-domain-transition-with-cinvoke}, or
\insnref{CJALR} instructions, as in \cref{sec:arch-sentry}).
%
One potential application of sealed capabilities is for use as
object-capability references -- i.e., as references to software-defined objects
with architecturally enforced encapsulation.  However, they are available to
software for more general use in constructing architecturally protected
references.

\pmnote{There is inconsistency in various places where a 18-bit
  \cotype{} is supposed to hold a 64-bit value like $2^{64}-1$. I've
  marked the places I've found; there might be others.}

\subsubsection{Base}

The \xlen{}-bit \cbase{} field is the base address of the segment described
by a capability.
The \cbase{} field is the \textit{lower bound} of the capability:
dereferencing an effective virtual address below \cbase{} will throw an
exception.
In the presence of compressed capabilities, not all possible \xlen{}-bit
values of
\cbase{} will be representable (see Section~\ref{compression}).

\subsubsection{Offset}

The \xlen{}-bit \coffset{} field holds a free-floating pointer that will be
added to the base when dereferencing a capability.
The value can float outside of the range described by the capability -- e.g.,
as a result of using \insnref{CSetOffset} to set the offset to a negative
value, or to a value greater than \clength{} -- but an exception will be
thrown if a requested dereference is out of range.
A non-zero offset may be used when a language-level pointer refers to a
location within a memory allocation or data structure; for example, to point
into the middle of a string, or at a non-zero index within an array.
A non-zero offset may also be used when the lower bound of a memory allocation
is insufficiently aligned to permit precise description with the \cbase{}
field of a compressed capability (see Section~\ref{compression}).

\subsubsection{Address}

The address, or \ccursor{}, of a capability is the sum of its
\cbase{} and \coffset{} fields.
The components of the virtual address may be accessed separately (e.g., via
\insnref{CGetOffset}), or as a single combined entity (e.g., via
\insnref{CGetAddr} and \insnref{CSetAddr}) depending on the software
use case.
For example, an integer cast of a C-language pointer might return either the
offset or the virtual address, depending on the C-language interpretation
being used.

\note{As presently defined, CGetAddr and CGetOffset appear not to carry out
bounds checks, which means that software really should get the length (and
base) and do the math as well if the bound(s) matter(s).  Could there be
utility to additional instructions for checked access when the intent is to
extract only in-bound offsets and addresses?  Or, to dodge the question
about what such a checked accessor returns when the cursor is out of bounds,
a CBTS/CBTU-like pair of tests for the cursor being in-bounds?  While a
CIncOffset by zero would clear the tag of an out of bounds capability, this
seems too fragile, too prone to optimization, to depend on from C.}{nwf}

\subsubsection{Length}

The \xlen{}-bit \clength{} field is the length of the segment described by a
capability.
The sum of \cbase{} and \clength{} is the \textit{upper bound} of the
capability: accessing at or above \cbase{} $+$ \clength{} will throw an
exception.
In the presence of compressed capabilities, not all possible \xlen{}-bit
values of \clength{} will be representable (see Section~\ref{compression}).

\subsection{Capability Values}

\subsubsection{Pointer Values in Capabilities}

In general, C and C++-language pointers are suitable to be represented as
memory capabilities (i.e., those that are unsealed and have a memory
interpretation by virtue of memory-related permissions).
This includes both data pointers, which may have enabled permissions that
include \cappermL, \cappermS, \cappermLC, and
\cappermSC, and code pointers, which may have enabled
permissions that include \cappermL, \cappermX, and
\cappermLC.
Other permissions, such as \cappermG or \cappermCInvoke, may also be present.
The following architectural values will normally be used:

\begin{itemize}
\item The \ctag{} is set.
\item The capability is unsealed (has \cotype{} of $2^{\xlen{}}-1$).
\item \cperms{} contains a suitable combination of load, store, and
  execute permissions, as well as other possible permissions.
\item \cbase{} will point to the bottom of the memory allocation, allowing for
  suitable alignment if bounds compression is used.
\item \coffset{} will point within the memory allocation (but may point
  outside in some circumstances).
\item The address will be equal to the integer value of the pointer.
\item \clength{} will be the length of the memory allocation, allowing for
  suitable alignment if bounds compression is used.
\end{itemize}

Code pointers will normally include \cappermL and \cappermLC
so that constant islands and global variables can be accessed via the code
segment.
Due to bounds compression, the memory allocation may require stronger than
word alignment or padding so as to ensure non-overlapping bounds with other
allocations.
Implied pointers in the run-time environment, originating in
compiler-generated code or the run-time linker, such as Program Linkage Table
(PLT) entries, Global Offset Table (GOT) entries, the Thread-Local Storage
(TLS) pointer, C++ v-table pointers, and return addresses, will typically have
similar values.
Note that the \cflags{} field may have an architecture-specific default value.

\subsubsection{The NULL Capability}

When representing C-language pointers as capabilities, it is important to have
a definition of NULL with as close-as-possible semantics to today's
definition that NULL has an integer value of 0.
We choose to define a NULL capability that has the following architecture
values set:

\begin{itemize}
\item \ctag{} is cleared.
\item The capability is unsealed (has \cotype{} of $2^{\xlen{}}-1$).
\item \cperms{} is 0x0.
\item \cflags{} is 0x0.
\item \cbase{} is 0x0.
\item \coffset{} is 0x0.
\item By implication, the virtual address of the capability is 0x0.
\item \clength{} is the largest permitted length ($2^{\xlen{}}$).
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Integer Values in Capabilities}
\label{subsection:integer_values_in_capabilities}

In the C language, the \ccode{intptr_t} type is intended to be an integer
type large enough to hold a pointer, and sees two common uses: an opaque field
that can hold either an integer or pointer type; or an integer type permitting
arithmetic and other integer operations on pointer values.
We find it convenient to store an integer value in a capability using the
following conventions:

\begin{itemize}
\item \ctag{} is cleared.
\item The capability is unsealed (has \cotype{} of $2^{\xlen{}}-1$).
\item \cperms{} is 0x0.
\item \cflags{} is 0x0.
\item \cbase{} is 0x0.
\item \coffset{} is the integer value to be stored.
\item By implication, the virtual address of the capability is the integer
  value to be stored.
\item \clength{} is the largest permitted length ($2^{\xlen{}}-1$).
\end{itemize}

Note that:

\begin{itemize}
\item Adding an integer value to the offset of a NULL capability (e.g., using
  \insnref{CIncOffset}) gives a capability that follows these
  conventions.
\item Maximal bounds allow the virtual address to take on any value without
  risking a bounds representability failure during arithmetic -- in contrast
  to using a maximum length of 0, which might otherwise seem intuitive.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{General-Purpose Capability Registers}

General-purpose capability registers are registers that are able to load,
store, inspect,
manipulate, and dereference capabilities while preserving their 1-bit tag and
full set of structured fields.
New capability-aware instructions (see
Section~\ref{sec:capability-aware-instructions}) allow use of new registers or
new fields added to existing registers, and via guarded manipulation must
implement properties such as tag preservation, monotonic transformation, and
so on.
Capability registers are tagged so that capability-oblivious operations --
such as tag-preserving memory copies of regions containing both data and
capabilities -- can be performed, preserving both set and unset tag bits.
This means that all capability-aware instructions dereferencing a capability
must check for a valid tag, as capability registers may contain data values
that are not permitted to be dereferenced.

CHERI architectures extend the existing general-purpose integer
register file to allow it to hold \xlen{}-sized integers and also capabilities, with
instructions selecting the desired semantics when utilizing a register.
This is similar to extension of 32-bit registers to 64-bit registers, in which
32-bit load, store, and manipulation can take place despite the full register
size being large enough to hold a 64-bit value.
A similar set of constraints applies: when an integer is loaded into a
capability-width register, the tag bit and remainder of the non-integer data
bits in the register must be zeroed, in similar manner to the use of zero or
sign extension when loading a smaller integer into a larger integer register.
When a register containing a tagged capability is used as an input to an
integer arithmetic operation, we recommend that the virtual address of a
capability be used as the integer value used for input.
\jhbnote{We should probably make clear here that the
  integer-into-a-cap-reg case follows Section
  ~\ref{subsection:integer_values_in_capabilities}.}

It is essential that intentionality be maintained: instructions
must not select between integer and capability interpretations based on the
tag value.
Instead, instructions must specifically interpret input and output registers
as integers or as capabilities.
If a capability dereference is expected, an exception must be thrown if the
input register does not contain a valid tag.
If an integer dereference is to be performed, only the integer portion of the
capability register will be used (per above, the virtual address of the
capability), and it will be indirected through an appropriate implied
capability such as the Program-Counter Capability (\PCC{}) or Default Data
Capability (\DDC{}).

Not all
integer registers may be extended to hold capabilities.
A tradeoff exists around the extension of existing well-supported ABIs, such
as the calling convention, vs. the impact of register-file growth and opcode
utilization.
Larger numbers of capability registers will increase the memory footprint of
context switching and the cost of stack spillage (where a callee cannot know
whether a register requires saving as a full capability or whether integer
width would be sufficient).
Similarly, larger numbers of available capability registers increase the
opcode footprint of capability-relative instructions.
While this opcode space is no greater than for integer-relative instructions,
in some architectures (e.g., ARMv8-A), opcode space is at a substantial premium,
and adding new capability variants of all load/store/jump instructions will
over-consume or exhaust the space.
Reducing the number of capability registers comes at other costs, such as
potentially disrupting current ABI design choices, and increasing register
pressure for pointer-intensive workloads.
Here, a variety of design points are available, but one option would be to
limit capabilities to a subset of the full register file, allowing a smaller
number of bits to name the available capability registers.
This pressure is especially acute in variable-size instruction sets (e.g.,
with the RISC-V compressed instruction set).
Other options to avoid this pressure include the introduction of new opcode
modes in which existing opcodes can be reused to refer to capabilities instead
of integers, at a cost to binary compatibility.
The most straightforward choice, where opcode space is plentiful with respect
to the vocabulary of load-store instructions, is to allow all existing
general-purpose integer registers to hold capabilities.

Microarchitectural and in-memory representations of capabilities may differ
substantially from the architectural representation in terms of size and
contents, but these differences will not be exposed via instructions operating
on capability-register fields.
See Section~\ref{compression} for a discussion of capability compression,
used to avoid storing a minimum of 3$\times$ \xlen{} bits in each capability.

\subsection{Special Capability Registers}
\label{section:special-capability-registers}

In addition to the general-purpose capability registers available for use via
capability load, store, jump, query, and manipulation instructions, there are
also a set of \textit{Special Capability Registers} (SCRs).
These capability registers provide similar functionality to
architecture-specific special registers such as RISC-V \textit{Control
  and Status Registers}.  In many cases, SCRs extend an existing
special register.
SCRs are accessed via new variants of architecture-specific
instructions used to access special registers, and serve specific
architectural functions.
Access to special capability registers is controlled on a case-by-case basis
and may be restricted based on \cappermASR, execution ring, or
exception-handling state.
The specific registers vary by underlying architecture, but will include the
following:

\begin{description}
\item[Program Counter Capability (\PCC{})] extends the existing Program
  Counter (\PC{}) to be a full capability, imposing validity, permission,
  bounds, and other checks on instruction fetch.

\item[Default Data Capability (\DDC{})] indirects legacy non-capability loads
  and stores, controlling and relocating data accesses to memory.
\end{description}

Although these capability special registers may be viewed as extensions to
existing special registers (e.g., \PC{}), CHERI introduces new
capability-based instructions to get and set their values, rather than
conflating them with existing integer-based special-register instructions in
the architecture ISA, in order to ensure intentional use.

Where existing special registers, such as the Program Counter (\PC{}),
are extended to become capabilities, the
semantics of accessing the integer interpretation must be determined with
care.
Unlike with the general-purpose integer register file, it may be desirable for
reasons of compatibility to modify the capability while retaining its tag
and other metadata (such as bounds and permissions) without modification --
subject to maintaining monotonicity.
For example, when modifying \PC{}, it is desirable to leave other fields (such
as bounds of \PCC{}) unmodified, and further to have integer accesses be
performed on \coffset{} rather than on the capability virtual address, so that
capability-unaware code can jump within its code segment without experiencing
a tag violation or being exposed to absolute virtual addresses.
%%%% SUCH AS BOUNDS was ambiguous, in a sentence with TOO MANY COMMAS,
%%%% and I may have miscorrected it.  PLEASE VET MY SECOND TRY.
These design choices allow accesses to be relocated relative to each of
these capabilities.\footnote{This is a design point on which we have had
considerable discussion, and for which other approaches would also be
reasonable.
For example, a virtual-address interpretation of \PC{} would also be
meaningful, but would place greater constraints on how capabilities were
used to constrain access by unmodified software.}

\subsection{Values Extended to Capabilities}

Several other existing values also require extending to hold
capabilities.  These values may be stored in a general-purpose
capability register, a special capability register, or some other
architecture-specific location.  When possible, the capability variant
should be stored as an extension of the equivalent value from the base
architecture:

\begin{description}
\item[Exception Program Counter Capability] Just as conventional
  architectures save the \PC{} following an exception and restore the
  \PC{} on exception return, CHERI architectures must save and restore
  the full \PCC{} when handling exceptions.

\item[Exception Code Capability] When an exception is taken, \PCC{} must
  be replaced with a code capability containing a suitable
  execution and security context for the exception handler.

\item[Exception Data Capability] When an exception is taken, the
  exception handler must have a way to access a suitable data
  capability for use by the exception handler.  This capability should
  permit access to a stack pointer as well as a value for \DDC{}.

\item[Thread-Local Storage] A capability extended
  version of a Thread-Local Storage (TLS) register, available to any executing
  code.
\end{description}

\section{Capabilities in Memory}

Maintaining the integrity and provenance validity of capabilities stored to,
and later read from, memory, is an essential feature of the CHERI
architecture.
Capabilities may be stored to memory in a broad variety of circumstances,
including, when language-level pointers are implemented using capabilities,
operating-system context switching, stack spills of capability registers,
stack storage for local pointer variables, pushing return capabilities to the
stack on function call, the capabilities held in Global Offset Table (GOT)
structures to reach global variables, global variables themselves holding
types implemented via capabilities, Procedure Linkage Table (PLT) entries
holding code capabilities that can be jumped to, and so on.
As tagged memory maintains tag bits at capability-sized, capability-aligned
intervals, stores of capabilities to memory will retain their tags only if
at suitable alignment.
This allows capabilities to be held at any suitably aligned memory location,
interleaved arbitrarily with other data -- such as is commonly the case with
pointers and other data today.

\subsection{In-Memory Representation}

As implemented in CHERI-RISC-V, all in-memory capability bits
are directly addressable via ordinary data accesses (e.g., byte loads) except
for the tag bit, which is stored ``out-of-band'' as a 65th or 129th bit.
The in-memory capability representation will typically not be a direct mapping
of architectural capability fields into memory, as fields may be stored as
partially computed values to improve performance (e.g., storing a virtual
address rather than base and offset), to reduce size (e.g., through bounds
compression), or to utilize multiple formats (e.g., for unsealed vs.\@ sealed
capabilities).
Given the prior definitions, we impose several constraints on the in-memory
representation:

\begin{description}
\item[NULL has an all zeroes in-memory representation, with cleared tag.]
  This definition allows zero-filled memory to be interpreted as NULL-filled
  memory when loaded as a capability, providing greater consistency with the
  C-language expectations for NULL pointers.

\item[The bottom \xlen{} bits of a capability hold its address value.]
  Supporting casts between a capability and an ordinary integer type sized to
  correspond to the size of a virtual address has significant utility in
  practical C code.
\end{description}

The CHERI Concentrate compression format used for both 64-bit and 128-bit
capabilities is described in Section~\ref{compression}.
These formats vary in terms of the number of permission bits they offer, and
also bounds precision effects stemming from capability compression. Concrete
architectures may additionally allocate bits for the \cflags{} field.
\pdrnote{Do we want to somehow specify the in-memory representation of \cflags{}?
It seems hard to do this in an arch-neutral manner.}

Software authors are discouraged from directly interpreting the in-memory
capability representation to improve the chances of software portability
(e.g., across architectures) and forward compatibility (e.g., with respect to
newly added permissions or other changes in field behavior).
This also allows multi-endian architectures or heterogeneous designs to utilize
a single endianness for in-memory capability storage (e.g., little endian) to
avoid ambiguities in which the same in-memory bit pattern might otherwise
describe two different sets of rights depending on where it is loaded and
interpreted.
This is also important given the desire to be able to retrieve the virtual
address or integer value of an in-memory capability by loading from the bottom
\xlen{} bits of the capability.

Despite the software benefits from avoiding encoding the in-memory capability
representation, it is important that the in-memory representation be
considered architectural (i.e., having a defined and externally consistent
representation) to better support systems software functions such as swap,
core dumps, debuggers, virtual-machine migration, and efficient run-time
linking, which may embed that representation within file formats or network
protocols.

\subsection{Tagged Memory}
\label{sec:tagged-memory}

CHERI relies on tagged physical memory: the association of a 1-bit {\em tag}
with each capability-sized, capability-aligned location in physical memory.
Associating tags with physical memory ensures that if memory is mapped at
multiple virtual addresses, the same tags will be loaded and stored regardless
of the virtual address through which it is accessed.
Tags must be atomically bound to the data they protect.
As a result, it is expected that tags will be cached with the memory they describe within the cache hierarchy.

When a capability-sized value in a capability register is written to a
capability-aligned area of memory using a capability store instruction, and
the capability via which the store takes place has suitable permissions, the
tag bit on the capability register will be stored atomically in memory with
the capability value.
Other stores of untagged capability values or other types (e.g., bytes, half
words, words, floats, doubles, and double words) across one or more
capability-aligned locations in memory will atomically clear the corresponding
tag bits for that memory.

When a capability-sized value is loaded into a capability register from a
capability-aligned location in memory using a capability load instruction, and
the capability via which the load takes place has suitable permissions, the
tag associated with that memory is loaded atomically into the register along
with the capability value.
Otherwise, loads will clear the capability register tag bit.

Strong atomicity properties are required such that it is not possible to
partially overwrite a capability value in memory while retaining the tag, or
partially load a capability and have the tag bit set.
These strong atomicity properties ensure that tag bits are set only on
capability values that have valid provenance -- i.e., that have not been
corrupted due to data stores into their contents, or undergone non-monotonic
transformations.
Our use of atomicity, in this context, has primarily to do with the visibility
of partial or interleaved results (which must not occur for capability stores
or tag clearing during data overwrite, or there is a risk that corrupted
capabilities might be dereferenceable), rather than ordering or visibility
progress guarantees (where we accept the memory model of the host
architecture).
This provides a set of properties that falls out naturally from current
microarchitectures and coherent memory-subsystem designs: atomicity is with
respect only to lines in the local cache, and not global state.

\subsection{Compressed Capabilities}
\label{compression}

In the abstract, full precision capabilities (i.e., those containing all of
the architectural capability fields at full width in their in-memory
representation) offer higher levels of software compatibility, but at a cost:
quadrupling the memory size of pointers implemented using capabilities.
This has significant software and micro-architectural costs to cache
footprint, memory bandwidth, and also in terms of the widths of memory paths
in the design.
However, CHERI is designed to be largely agnostic to the in-memory
representation, permitting alternative ``compressed'' representations while
retaining largely compatible software behavior.
Compression is possible because the base, length, and pointer values in
capabilities are frequently redundant. For example the pointer is often
within bounds and the length small, so the most significant bits of the pointer,
base and upper bound are likely to be the same.
This can be exploited by increasing
the alignment requirements on bounds associated with a pointer (while
retaining full precision for the pointer itself) and encoding the bounds relative
to the pointer with limited precision.
Space can further be recovered by reducing the number of permission and reserved bits.

Using this approach, it is possible to usefully represent capabilities via a
compressed 128-bit in-memory representation, while retaining a 64-bit
architectural view of their fields.
Compression results in a loss of precision, exposed as a requirement for stronger
bounds alignment, for larger memory allocations.
Because of the representation, we are able to vary the
requirement for alignment based on the size of the allocation, and for small
allocations ($< 4$ KiB), impose no additional alignment requirements.
The design retains full monotonicity: no setting of bounds or adjustment of
the pointer value can cause bounds to increase, granting further rights -- but
care must be taken to ensure that intended reductions in rights occur where
desired.
Some manipulations of pointers could lead to unrepresentable bounds (as the
bounds are no longer redundant to content in the pointer): in this case, which
occurs when pointers are moved substantially out of bounds, the tag will be
cleared preventing further dereferencing.

For bounds imposed by memory allocators, this is not a substantial cost:
heap, stack, and OS allocators already impose alignment in order to achieve
natural word, pointer, page, or superpage alignment in order to allow fields
to be accessed and efficient utilization of virtual-memory features in the
architecture.
For software authors wishing to impose narrower bounds on arbitrary subsets of
larger structures, the precision effects can become visible: it is no longer
possible to arbitrarily subset objects over the $4$ KiB threshold without
alignment adjustments to bounds.
This might occur, for example, if a programmer explicitly requested small and
unaligned bounds within a much larger aligned allocation -- such as might be
the case for video frame data within a $1$ GiB memory mapping.
In such cases, care must be taken to ensure that this cannot lead to buffer
overflows with potential security consequences.  Alignment
requirements are further explored in \cref{sec:ccalignment} and \cref{sec:cheri-128-alignment}.

Different representations might be used for unsealed data capabilities versus
sealed capabilities used for object-capability invocation.
Data capabilities experience very high levels of precision intended to support
string subsetting operations on the stack, in-memory protocol parsing, and
image processing.
Sealed capabilities require additional fields, such as the object type and
further permissions, but because they are unused by current software, and
represent coarser-grained uses of memory, greater alignment can be enforced in
order to recover space for these fields.
Even stronger alignment requirements could be enforced for the default data
capability in order to avoid further arithmetic addition in the ordinary RISC
load and store paths, where a bitwise or, rather than addition, is possible
due to zeroed lower bits in strongly aligned bounds.

CHERI ISAv8 specifies a single compression scheme for capabilities,
CHERI Concentrate.\footnote{CHERI-128 (\cref{app:cheri-128}), our previous
compression format, is now deprecated.}

\subsection{CHERI Concentrate Compression}
\label{subsec:cheri-concentrate}

In this section, we describe how CHERI Concentrate compresses the bounds used
in 128-bit capabilities with 64-bit architectural addresses.\footnote{A
variant of CHERI Concentrate is used in Arm Morello, but with different
precision constants and a slightly different encoding format.}

\caption{CHERI Concentrate 128-bit capability format and decoding}
\label{fig:cheric128}
\vspace{-1.5em}
\end{figure}

CHERI Concentrate is a compressed capability encoding that uses a floating point
representation to encode the bounds relative to the capability's address~\cite{Woodruff2019}.
It is a development from the CHERI-128 compression format described in \cref{app:cheri-128}.
For a more detailed rational behind some of the encoding decisions see \cref{sec:rational:comressed}.

\Cref{fig:cheric128} shows the capability format and decoding method for 128-bit CHERI concentrate.
The format contains a 64-bit address, $a$, 16 permission bits (4 user defined and 12 hardware defined), an 18-bit object type and 27 bits that encode the bounds relative to the address.
The following definitions are used in the description of the bounds encoding:\note{Would be useful if this list could be opposite \cref{fig:cheric128}}{rmn30}

\begin{description}

\item[$MW$] is the \emph{mantissa width}, a parameter of the encoding that
  determines the precision of the bounds. For 128-bit capabilities we
  use $MW = 14$, but this could be adjusted depending on
  the number of bits available in the capability format.

\item[$B$ and $T$] are $MW$-bit values that are substituted into the
  capability address to form the base and top. They are stored in a
  slightly compressed form in the encoding, in one of two formats
  depending on the $I_E$ bit.

\item[$I_E$] is the \emph{internal exponent} bit that selects between
  two formats. If the bit is set then an exponent is stored instead of
  the lower three bits of $B$ and $T$ fields ($B_E$ and $T_E$),
  reducing the precision available by three bits. Otherwise the
  exponent is implied to be zero and the full width of $B$ and $T$ are
  used.

\item[$E$] is the 6-bit \emph{exponent}. It determines the position at which
  $B$ and $T$ are inserted in $a$. Larger values allow larger regions
  to be encoded but impose stricter alignment restrictions on the
  bounds.

\end{description}
% The object type is set to all ones for unsealed capabilities and we reserve object types below 4 for future use.

In more detail the base, $b$, and top, $t$, are derived from the
address by substituting the $MW$ `middle bits' (bits $E$ to $E + MW$)
of $a$, $a_\text{mid}$, with $B$ and $T$ respectively and clearing the
lower $E$ bits.  In order to allow for memory regions that span
alignment boundaries and so that $a$ can roam over a larger region
while maintaining the original bounds the most significant bits of
$a$ may be adjusted up or down by one using
corrections $c_b$ and $c_t$ which are described later.

The $I_E$ bit selects between two cases: the $I_E = 0$ case with zero
exponent for regions less than $2^{12}$ bytes long or the
\emph{internal exponent} case with $E$ stored in the lower bits of $T$
and $B$.  In the latter case $E$ is chosen such that the most
significant non-zero bit of the length of the region aligns
with $T[12]$ in the decoded top.  This means that the top two bits of
$T$ can be derived from $B$ using the equality $T = B + L$, where
$L[12]$ is known from the values of $I_E$ and $E$ and a carry out is
implied if $T[11..0] < B[11..0]$ (because we know that the top is more
than the base).  Storing the exponent in the lower bits of $T$ and $B$
means that there is less bounds precision for non-zero exponents, but
we consider this an acceptable compromise to save encoding bits given
that larger objects are more likely to have aligned bounds or be
easily padded to alignment boundaries.

addresses on the left are for a \texttt{0x6000}-byte object located at \texttt{0x1E000};

\label{fig:ccregions}
\end{figure}

If we required that $t$ and $b$ had the same $a_\text{top}$ bits above $E + 14$, the lower bits of $a$ would give us an aligned $s = 2^{E+14}$ space of values over which $a$ can range without changing the decoded bounds.
Requiring this space to be aligned would be an unacceptable restriction for software, so we make use of `spare' encodings where $T$ is less than $B$ to allow an arbitrary space boundary, $R$, that is relative to the base, calculated by subtracting one from the top three bits of $B$.
If $B$, $T$ or $a_\text{mid}$ is less than $R$ we infer that they lie in the $2^{E+14}$ aligned region above $R$ labelled $\text{space}_U$ in \cref{fig:ccregions}.
This allows us to compute the corrections to $a_\text{top}$, $c_b$ and $c_t$, shown in the tables in \cref{fig:cheric128}.
The overall effect is that we guarantee at least $ \frac{1}{8} s$ bytes below the base and $ \frac{1}{4} s $ above top where $a$ can roam out-of-bounds while still allowing us to recover the bounds.

Additionally there is one corner case in the decoding that must be correctly handled:
to allow the entire 64-bit address space to be addressable we permit $t$ to be up to $2^{64}$ (i.e. a 65-bit value), but this bit-size mismatch introduces some additional complication when decoding.
The following condition is required to correct $t$ for capabilities whose representable region wraps the edge of the address space:
\[ \algorithmicif\ ((E<51) \mathop{\&} ((t[64:63]-b[63]) > 1))\ \algorithmicthen\ t[64] = !t[64]\]
That is, if the decoded length of the capability is larger than $E$ allows, invert the most significant bit of $t$.

\subsubsection{CHERI Concentrate Encoding (Set Bounds)}
\label{sec:cheri-concentrate-encoding-set-bounds}

To encode a capability with requested base, $b$, length, $l$, and top, $t = b + l$, using this encoding we must first determine $E$ by finding the most significant set bit of $l$. We select an $E$ that aligns $T[12]$ with the most significant set bit of $l$ as required for the top two bits of $T$ to be inferred correctly when decoded:
\[
E = 52 - \text{CountLeadingZeros}(l[64:13])
\]
Note that $l$ is a 65-bit value allowing the maximum possible length of $2^{64}$ to be encoded with $E=52$, $T=2^{12}$ and $B=0$. We exclude the lower 12 bits of $l$ because lengths less than this are encoded with $E = 0$ and $I_E$ set depending on the value of $l[12]$ ($L_{msb}$):
\[
I_E =
\begin{cases}
0,\text{ if }E=0\text{ and }l[12] = 0 \\
1,\text{ otherwise}
\end{cases}
\]
The values of $B$ and $T$ are formed by extracting the relevant bits from $b$ and $t$. For $I_E = 0$ this means:
\[
B = b[13:0] \\
T = t[11:0]
\]
With $I_E = 1$, we discard the lower bits and also lose three bits of each to store the exponent:
\[
B = b[E+13:E+3] \\
T = t[E+11:E+3]
\]
If in truncating $t$ we have rounded it down (i.e., if there were any set bits in $t[E+2:0]$) then we must increment $T$ by one to ensures that the encoded region includes the requested top as required by \insnref{CSetBounds}.
Rounding up $t$ to a $2^{E+3}$ aligned value may increase the length, and therefore might cause $L_{msb}$ to increase by one, therefore mandating that the $E$ of the resulting capability also increase so that $L_{msb}$ lands at exactly $E+12$ to ensure correct decoding.
Selecting a new $E$ forces a fresh selection of $T$ and $B$, but is certain not to overflow again.

\subsubsection{CHERI Concentrate Alignment Requirements}
\label{sec:ccalignment}
For a requested base and length to be exactly representable the CHERI concentrate format may require additional alignment requirements:
\begin{itemize}
\item
  For allocations with $I_E = 0$ (i.e. lengths less than $4$ kiB for $MW = 14$) there is no specific alignment requirement.

\item
  For larger allocations the base and length must be aligned to $2^{E+3}$ byte
  boundaries (i.e., the $E + 3$ least significant bits are zero).
  $E$ is determined from the requested length $l$ and is subject to rounding such that an
  $E_{\text{initial}}$ is calculated for $l$, which is then aligned up to $l_{\text{aligned}}$ which is used to derive
  the final $E$.
  Specifically, $E = E_{\text{initial}} + C$, where $E_{initial} = 52 - \text{CountLeadingZeros}(l[64:13])$
  and $C$ is an additional carry
  bit from rounding up the truncated (to $E_{\text{initial}} + 3 + MW - 4$ bits) length to a
  multiple of $2^{E+3}$ (that is, $C = 1$ if and only if any of the $E_{\text{initial}} + 3$
  least significant bits of $l$ are non-zero and the next $MW - 4$ least
  significant bits of $l$ are all $1$).

\item
  No additional alignment requirements are currently placed on sealed capabilities or on \DDC{}.
\end{itemize}
Note that there is a jump in required alignment from 1-byte to 8-bytes at the transition between $I_E = 0$ and $I_E = 1$ caused by using the lower 3 bits of $T$ and $B$ to store the exponent.

\subsubsection{CHERI Concentrate Fast Representable Limit Checking}
\label{sec:cheri-concentrate-fast-representable-limit-checking}
%
% This text pulled from the CHERI Concentrate paper, section 6.3, but 8/9-bit
% values converted to 13/14-bit values.
%

Pointer arithmetic is typically performed using addition, and does not raise an exception.
If we wish to preserve these semantics for capabilities, capability pointer addition
must fit comfortably within the delay of simple arithmetic in the pipeline, and should not introduce the possibility of an exception.
For CC, as with Low-fat, typical pointer addition requires adding only an offset to the pointer address, leaving the rest of the capability fields unchanged.
However, it is possible that the address could pass either the upper or the lower limits of the representable space, beyond which the original bounds can no longer be reconstituted.
In this case, CHERI Concentrate clears the tag of the resulting capability to maintain memory safety, preventing an illegal reference to memory from being forged.
This check against the representable limit, $R$, has been designed to be much faster than a precise bounds check, thereby eliminating the costly measures the Low-fat design required to achieve reasonable performance.
%While we could push the check to the exception path, exceptions
%on arithmetic instructions prevent certain reorderings in a complex pipeline
%and are avoided in modern RISC architectures.

To ensure that the critical path is not unduly lengthened, CHERI Concentrate verifies that an increment $i$ will not compromise the encoding by inspecting only $i$ and the original
address field. We first ascertain if
$i$ is \emph{inRange}, and then if it is \emph{inLimit}.
The \emph{inRange} test determines whether the magnitude of $i$ is greater than that of the size of the representable space, $s$,
which would certainly take the address out of representable limits:
\[ inRange = -s < i < s\]
The \emph{inLimit} test assumes the success of the \emph{inRange} test, and determines
whether the update to $A_\text{mid}$ could take it beyond the representable limit, outside the representable space:
\[
  inLimit=\begin{cases}
             I_\text{mid} < (R - A_\text{mid} - 1),& \text{if } i \geqslant 0 \\
             I_\text{mid} \geqslant (R - A_\text{mid}) \text{~and~} R \neq A_\text{mid},& \text{if } i < 0
           \end{cases}
\]
The \emph{inRange} test reduces to a test that all the bits of $I_\text{top}$ ($i[63:E+14]$) are the same.
The \emph{inLimit} test needs only 14-bit fields ($I_\text{mid}=i[E+13,E]$) and the sign of $i$.

The $I_\text{mid}$ and $A_\text{mid}$ used in the \emph{inLimit} test do not include the lower bits
of $i$ and $a$, potentially ignoring a carry in from the lower bits, presenting an \emph{imprecision hazard}.
We solve this by conservatively subtracting one from the representable limit
when we are incrementing upwards, and by not allowing any subtraction when $A_\text{mid}$ is equal to $R$.
%These are simplified to a single comparison and two equivalence checks in our
%implementation.
%\begin{align*}
%  &inLimit=\begin{cases}
%              \neg{GT} \text{~and~} I_\text{mid} \neq (R - 1),& \text{if } i \geqslant 0 \\
%              GT \text{~and~} R \neq A_\text{mid},& \text{if } i < 0 \\
%            \end{cases}\\
%  &\text{where } GT = I_\text{mid} \geqslant (R - A_\text{mid})
%\end{align*}

One final test is required to ensure that if $E \geqslant 50$, any increment is representable.
(If $E = 50$, the representable space, $s$, encompases the entire address space.)
This handles a number of corner cases related to $T$, $B$, and $A_\text{mid}$ describing
bits beyond the top of a virtual address.
Our final fast \emph{representability} check composes these three tests:
\[ representable = (inRange  \text{~and~}  inLimit)  \text{~or~}  (E \geqslant 50)\]

To summarize, the representability check depends only on four 14-bit fields, $T$, $B$, $A_\text{mid}$,
and $I_\text{mid}$, and the sign of $i$.
Only $I_\text{mid}$ must be extracted during execute, as $A_\text{mid}$ is cached
in our register file.
%This operation is simpler than reconstructing even one full bound, as
%demonstrated in Section~\ref{sec:eval:microarch}.
This fast representability check allows us to perform pointer arithmetic on compressed capabilities directly, avoiding decompressing capabilities in the register file that introduces both a dramatically enlarged register file and substantial load-to-use delay.

\subsection{Capability Address and Length Rounding Instructions}
\label{sec:capability-address-and-length-rounding}

Capability compression requires stronger alignment as allocation sizes
increase.
For infrequent allocations of large memory mappings, the software cost of
calculating suitable alignment is small.
However, stack allocations occur frequently and have less tolerance for
arithmetic overheads.
Further, it may be desirable for an architecture to support a range of
compression parameters -- for example, the bits invested in exponents, top,
and bottom fields.
In this case, having the architecture calculate requirements based on its
specific parametrization would be beneficial.
We propose two new instructions that allow the architecture to provide
information to memory allocators regarding precision effects:

\begin{description}
\item[CRepresentableAlignmentMask (CRAM)] \insnref{CRAM} accepts a proposed
  bounds length, and returns a mask suitable for use in aligning down the
  address of an allocation.

\item[CRoundRepresentableLength (CRRL)] \insnref{CRRL} accepts a proposed
  bounds length, and returns a rounded-up size that will be accepted by
  \insnref{CSetBoundsExact} without throwing an exception.
\end{description}

Collectively, these instructions can be used to efficiently calculate
suitable base and length alignment, to permit exception-free bounds setting
using \insnref{CSetBoundsExact}.
They are intended to be well suited for use with dynamic stack allocation --
e.g., using \ccode{alloca}, but also other types of allocation.

\subsection{32-bit Modes on 64-bit Architectures}

We currently consider 32-bit execution modes on 64-bit processors to be legacy
compatibility modes, and hence do not define capability instruction-set
extensions for those modes.
The essential design goal is therefore to maintain CHERI's security properties
while enabling the execution of 32-bit capability-unaware code.

Our recommendation is that capability-aware instructions be inaccessible in
32-bit modes, and that it be impossible for executing code to introduce
capability values that violate provenance validity and monotonicity
properties.
Any writes of non-capability values into capability-extended general-purpose
registers should be treated in a similar manner to integer writes into those
registers in the capability-aware execution environment: they should clear the
remainder of the register including the tag bit.
Writes of integer values into capability-extended special-purpose registers
will need similar handling to 64-bit writes: in some cases they should clear
the tag, and in other cases they should modify the offset being accessed, in
a manner similar to changes to \PC{}, and so on.

While this appears to be a coherent design direction, we have not validated
this approach in architecture.

\section{Capability State on CPU Reset}
\label{sec:capability-state-on-cpu-reset}

Although the architecture-neutral description of CHERI does not define a
specific set of capability registers (or capability extensions to existing
registers), there are architecture-neutral invariants that must be maintained
from the time of processor reset.
An initial set of strong \textit{root capabilities} must be available from
inception for use by software.
Most critically, the \textit{program-counter capability} must authorize the
execution of code following reset, and will typically cover the entire virtual
address space.
Similarly, at least one suitable root \textit{data capability} is necessary to
authorize access for data loads and stores; this will typically also cover the
entire virtual address space.

An important design question is whether multiple roots are present, and if so,
whether they define disjoint trees of potential capabilities.
For example, the initial program-counter capability might grant load and
execute permissions but not store permission; similarly, an initial data
capability might grant load and store permissions but not execute permissions.
Due to monotonicity rules, this would prevent the later creation of any
capability holding both store and execute permissions (``W\^{}X'').
Similarly, it is easy to imagine using additional independent capability roots
for orthogonal architectural rights, such as sealing and unsealing permission
vs.\@ memory access, which utilize independent namespaces (object types vs.\@
virtual addresses).  Additional discussion may be found in
\cref{app:exp:compressperm}.

In general, we have taken the view that initial architectural root
capabilities should hold all permissions, both architecture-defined and
software-defined, allowing software the flexibility to implement any suitable
models.
This impacts higher-level software behavior substantially: for example,
certain current POSIX APIs (e.g., \ccode{mmap()} combined with
\ccode{mprotect()}) assume that decisions about load, store, and execute
combinations can be made dynamically, and that it is possible to have pointers
that hold all three permissions.

Depending on compatibility and security goals, software might choose to expose
independent roots in its own structure -- e.g., by not granting sealing
permission to user code using code or data capabilities, instead returning
a specific sealing root capability via a separate system call, allowing only
certain object types to be used directly by userspace.
The main downsides to this view are that the architecture itself does not
directly embody invariants such as W\^{}X, and that this also prevents use of
different formats for disjoint provenance trees of capabilities with orthogonal
functions -- e.g., the use of different formats for memory-access vs.\@ sealing
capabilities.
We choose to accept these costs in return for a more flexible software model
in which all root capabilities at processor reset hold all permissions.

\subsection{Capability Registers on Reset}

When the CPU is hard reset, all capability registers intended to act as roots
will be initialized to the following values:

\begin{itemize}
\item
The \ctag{} bit is set.
\item
\coffset{} = 0, except for the program-counter capability, which will have its
\coffset{} initialized to an appropriate boot vector address.
Other architecture-specific capability registers may have other initial values
-- e.g., as relates to exception vectors.
\item
\cbase{} = 0
\item
\clength{} = $2^{\xlen{}}$.
\item
\cotype{} = $2^{\xlen{}}-1$ (truncated as required by the implementation's encoding).
\item
All available permission bits are set; other bits will be returned as zero
architecturally.
% \nwfnote{Bits 8 and 9 are now taken, no longer reserved, yes?}
% Permission bits 8 and 9 are currently reserved for future use; these are
% included in the the 31 (or 15) permission bits that are set on reset).
\item
Concrete architectures specify the reset value of \cflags{} for root capabilities.
\item
All unused bits are cleared.
\end{itemize}

\noindent
Capability registers not intended to act as roots will be
initialized to hold untagged values:

\begin{itemize}
\item
The \ctag{} bit is unset.
\item
\coffset{} = 0 (or some other value appropriate to the register).
\item
\cbase{} = 0.
\item
\clength{} = $2^{\xlen{}}$.
\item
\cotype{} = $2^{\xlen{}}-1$ (truncated as required by the implementation's encoding).
\item
All available permission bits are unset.
\item
\cflags{} = 0x0.
\item
All unused bits are cleared.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Tagged Memory on Reset}

In an ideal world, all tags in memory are cleared on CPU reset, as this avoids
the unpredictable introduction of additional capability roots.
However, this is not straightforward to offer architecturally or
microarchitecturally.
We instead rely on firmware or software supervisors to ensure that pages
placed into use, especially with untrustworthy code, have been properly
cleared.
This property is often already enforced by real-world hardware and
systems -- whether due to Error-Correcting Codes
(ECC),\footnote{To avoid any potential confusion, we note that ECC is also widely used for Elliptic-Curve Cryptography.} or because of page zeroing by the OS.
However, the criticality of this behavior becomes quite high given the risks
associated with errant tagged values.

\section{Capability-Aware Instructions}
\label{sec:capability-aware-instructions}

A key design choice in the CHERI protection model is \textit{intentionality}:
the use of explicit instructions that accept (and require) capability
operands rather than overloading existing instructions, allowing selection of
integer-relative or capability-relative semantics.
In particular, it is essential that selection of integer or capability
semantics never be conditional on the value of the operand's tag.
This requires not just the introduction of instructions to inspect,
manipulate, load, and store capabilities, as a new CPU data type, but also a
set of explicit load, store, and control-flow instructions accepting capability
operands as the base address or jump target where the baseline ISA would
accept explicit integer operands.

We have generally attempted to minimize the number of new instructions.
However, in some cases multiple variants are required to optimize important
code paths -- for example, capability bounds can be set using both an integer register
operand (\insnref{CSetBounds}), where there is a dynamically defined
size, such as when using \ccode{malloc}, and an immediate operand
(\insnref{CSetBoundsImm}), where there is a compilation-time size
available, such as for most stack-allocated buffers.

Where possible, the structure and semantics of capability instructions have been
aligned with similar core instructions, similar calling conventions, and so on.
CHERI depends on introducing several new classes of instructions to the
baseline ISA.
In some cases these are congruent to similar instructions relating to
general-purpose integer registers, control-flow manipulation, and memory
accesses, in the form of capability-register manipulation, jumps to
capabilities, and capability-relative memory accesses.
Others have functions specific to CHERI, such as those manipulating capability
fields, and those relating to protection-domain transition.
The semantics of these instructions implements many aspects of the protection
model; for example, constraints on permission and bounds manipulation in
capability field manipulation instructions contribute to enforcing CHERI's
capability monotonicity properties.
These instructions are described in detail in Chapter~\ref{chap:isaref-riscv}:

\begin{description}
\item[Retrieve capability fields]
These instructions extract specific capability-register fields and move their
values into general-purpose (integer) registers:
\insnref{CGetAddr},
\insnref{CGetBase}, \insnref{CGetFlags}, \insnref{CGetLen},
\insnref{CGetOffset}, \insnref{CGetPerm}, \insnref{CGetSealed},
\insnref{CGetTag}, and \insnref{CGetType}.

\item[Capability move]
This instruction moves a capability from one register to another without
change: \insnref{CMove}.

\item[Manipulate capability fields]
These instructions modify capability-register fields, setting them to values
moved from integer registers, subject to constraints such as monotonicity and
representability: \insnref{CAndAddr}, \insnref{CAndPerm},
\insnref{CClearTag},
\insnref{CIncOffset}, \insnref{CIncOffsetImm},
\insnref{CSetAddr}, \insnref{CSetBounds},
\insnref{CSetBoundsExact}, \insnref{CSetBoundsImm},
\insnref{CSetFlags}, and
\insnref{CSetOffset}.

\item[Derive integer pointers from capabilities, or capabilities from integer
pointers]
The \insnref{CToPtr} and \insnref{CFromPtr} instructions efficiently
convert between integer pointers and capabilities, performing suitable bounds
checks against contextual capabilities.
These support efficient hybrid code, in which use of integer pointers and
capabilities are intermixed.

\item[Capability pointer comparison and arithmetic]
These instructions provide pointer comparison and
subtraction behavior: \insnref{CSetEqualExact}, \insnref{CSub}, and
\insnref{CTestSubset}.

\item[Load or store via a capability]
These instructions access memory indirected via an explicitly named capability
register, and will ideally correspond to a full range of contemporary
indexing modes present in the baseline ISA -- for example, allowing aligned or
unaligned access to zero-extended and sign-extended integers of varying
widths, as well as loading and storing of capabilities themselves.
Further, software stacks dependent on atomic operations on pointers will
require a suitable suite of atomic operations loading, modifying, and storing
capabilities -- e.g., load-linked, store-conditional instructions, or atomic
test-and-set instructions, depending on the underlying architecture.
CHERI-RISC-V adds \insnref{CLC} and \insnref{CSC} to load and store
capabilities as well as a new instruction decoding mode in which existing
memory access instructions use capability registers as the base
address instead of integer registers.  CHERI-RISC-V also adds new
instructions which explicitly use a capability register as the base
address regardless of decoding mode including
\insnref[loaddatacap]{L[BHWD][U].CAP}, \insnref[loadcapcap]{LC.CAP},
\insnref[storedatacap]{S[BHWD][U].CAP}, and \insnref[storecapcap]{SC.CAP}.

These correspond in semantics to the similar baseline ISA instructions, but
are constrained by the properties of the named capability including tag check,
permissions, bounds, seal check, and so on; if capability protections would be
violated, then an exception will be thrown.
Capability restrictions can be used to implement spatial safety via
permissions and bounds.

Additionally, the \insnref{CLoadTags} instruction provides direct,
\emph{read-only} access to capability tags; see
\cref{sec:rationale:cloadtags}.

\item[Program-Counter Capability]
Generated code makes frequent reference to \PCC{} in common position-independent
code structures, such as references to the Global Offset Table (GOT) or
Program Linkage Table (PLT).
CHERI-RISC-V extends the base \insnnoref{AUIPC} instruction with
\insnref{AUIPCC} that adds an offset to \PCC{}.

\item[Capability jumps]
Capability-based code pointers allow the implementation of control-flow
robustness by limiting the permissions and bounds on jump targets (e.g.,
preventing store, and limiting fetchable instructions).
Depending on the underlying ISA, different jump variations may be required --
for example, adding capability variants of jump-and-link register, jump
register, and so on, including: \insnref{JALR.CAP} and \insnref{CJALR}.

\item[Capability sealing]
The \insnref{CSeal} and \insnref{CUnseal} instructions seal or
unseal capabilities given a suitable authorizing capability (i.e., one with
the \cappermSeal or \cappermUnseal permission as appropriate).
Sealed capabilities allow software to implement encapsulation, such as is
required for software compartmentalization.  The \insnref{CSealEntry}
instruction constructs \emph{hardware-interpreted} sealed entry (`sentry')
capabilities; see \cref{sec:arch-sentry}.

\item[Protection-domain switching]
The \insnref{CInvoke} instruction is a
primitive upon which protection-domain switching can be implemented.
\insnref{CInvoke} has a jump-based semantic that
unseals its sealed code and data capability-register operands.
This allows software-controlled non-monotonicity by granting
access to additional state via unsealing.

\item[Fast register clear]
The \insnref{CClear} and \insnref{FPClear} instructions clear a range of capability,
integer, or floating-point registers to support fast protection-domain
transition.

\item[Special capability registers]
Special capability registers are read and written via \insnref{CSpecialRW}.

\item[Tag loading and rederivation]
Certain system operations, such as process or virtual-machine checkpointing
and memory compression, require that tagged memory have its tags saved and
then restored.
Memory locations can be iteratively loaded into capability registers to check
for tags; tags can then be later restored by manually rederived manually using
instructions such as \insnref{CAndPerm} and \insnref{CSetBounds}.
However, these instruction sequence is complex and can incur substantial
overhead when used during bulk restoration.
The \insnref{CLoadTags} instruction allows tags to be loaded for a cache
line of memory (non-temporally), and the \insnref{CBuildCap},
\insnref{CCopyType}, and \insnref{CCSeal} instructions allow tags to
be efficiently restored.

\item[Compartment identifiers]
CHERI protection domains, when constructed purely of graphs of capabilities,
do not allow the microarchitecture to explicitly identify one domain from
another.
In order to allow tagging of microarchitectural state, such as
branch-predictor entries, to avoid side channels, instructions are present to
allow software to explicitly identify compartment boundaries where
confidentiality requirements preclude more extensive microarchitectural
sharing: \insnref{CGetCID} and \insnref{CSetCID}.

\item[Capability Address and Length Rounding Instructions]
Capability compression requires stronger alignment as allocation
sizes increase  as described in
Section~\ref{sec:capability-address-and-length-rounding}.
\insnref{CRAM} and \insnref{CRRL} can be used by allocators to enforce
non-overlapping bounds for distinct allocations.
\end{description}

\section{Protection-Domain Transition with CInvoke}
\label{section:protection-domain-transition-with-cinvoke}

Cross-domain procedure calls are implemented using the \insnref{CInvoke}
instruction, which provides access to controlled non-monotonicity for the
purposes of a privileged capability register-file transformation and memory
access.
The instruction accepts two capability-register operands, which represent the
sealed code and data capability describing a target protection domain.
\insnref{CInvoke} checks that the two capabilities are valid, that both are
sealed, that the code capability is executable, that the data capability is
non-executable, and that they have a matching object type.

\insnref{CInvoke} unseals the sealed code and data capabilities
and places them in \PCC{} and \IDC{} (an architecture-specific
capability register), with control transferred
directly to the target code capability.
A programming-language or concurrent programming-framework runtime might
arrange that all sealed code capabilities point to a message-passing
implementation that proceeds to check argument registers or clear other
registers, switching directly to the target domain via a further
\insnref{CJR}, or returning to the caller if the message will be delivered
asynchronously.

Voluntary protection-domain crossing -- i.e., not triggered by an interrupt --
will typically be modeled as a form of function invocation or message passing
by the operating system.
In either case, it is important that function callers/callees, message
senders/recipients, and the operating system itself, be constructed to protect
themselves from potential confidentiality or integrity problems arising from
leaked or improperly consumed general-purpose integer registers or
capabilities passed across domain transition.
On invocation, callers will wish to ensure that non-argument registers, as
well as unused argument registers, are cleared.
Callees will wish to receive only expected argument registers.
Similarly, on return, callees will wish to ensure that non-return registers,
as well as unused return registers, are cleared.
Likewise, callers will wish to receive back only expected return values.
In practice, responsibility for this clearing lies with multiple of the
parties: for example, only the compiler may be aware of which argument
registers are unused for a particular function, whereas the operating system
or message-passing routine may be able to clear other registers.
Work performed by the operating system as a trusted intermediary in a
reliable way may be usefully depended on by either party in order to prevent
duplication of effort.
For example, if the OS the clears non-argument
registers on call, and non-return registers on return, caller and
callee can avoid clearing those registers allowing that clearing
to occur exactly once.
\jhbnote{I'm tempted to replace OS in this paragraph with something
  like ``domain-transfer supervisor'' since the intermediary may well
  live in user space (like the runtime linker).}
Efficient register clearing instructions (e.g., \insnref{CClear}) can
also be used to substantially accelerate this process.

In CHERI, the semantics of secure message passing or invocation are software defined, and we anticipate that different operating-system and programming-language security models might handle these, and other behaviors, in different ways.
For example, in our prototype CheriBSD implementation, a userspace supervisor maintains a ``trusted stack'' onto which values are pushed during invocation, and from which values are popped on return.
Over time, we anticipate providing multiple sets of semantics, perhaps corresponding to less synchronous domain-transition models, and allowing different userspace runtimes to select (or implement) the specific semantics their programming model requires.
This is particularly important in order to provide flexible error handling: if a sandbox suffers a fault, or exceeds its execution-time budget, it is the OS and programming language that will define how recovery takes place, rather than the ISA definition.

\section{Sealed Entry Capabilities}
\label{sec:arch-sentry}

CHERI borrows from earlier capability architectures a notion of immutable
capabilities that are usable solely as jump targets, most notably the
M-machine \cite{carter:mmachine94}, where these are called ``\emph{enter}
capabilities.''
%
These reside somewhere between CHERI's unsealed and sealed
\cappermX-bearing capabilities.  Because they act in tandem with
CHERI's sealing mechanism and describe function entry points, we use the
name `sealed entry' capability or just `sentry,' for short.
%
Similar to sealed capabilities, sentry capabilities are immutable by their
bearer and do not authorize memory loads or stores.  Like unsealed
capabilities, the bearer may directly jump to the sentry to begin executing
the instructions it references.  The jump instruction atomically unseals the
sentry and installs it to the program counter capability register.  In our
implementations, we use the same instruction (e.g., \insnref{CJR} or
\insnref{CJALR}) to vector control through either unsealed or sentry
capabilities, so that code can be oblivious to whether it is jumping through
an ordinary code capability or a sentry.  One could, of course, imagine
instructions that enforced the type of their operand.

Since userspace function pointers are often passed to kernels for use in
callbacks, such as signal handlers, performing an exception return
(\insnnoref{ERET} on ARMv8-A, \xRET{} on RISC-V and
\insnnoref{IRET} on x86) also atomically unseals the implicit jump target
when installing it to \PCC{} just like a normal capability jump instruction,
rather than forcing the kernel to re-derive an unsealed capability for the same
function. However, due to the need for kernels to perform actions such as
emulating unaligned accesses or unimplemented instructions, and thus manually
increment the application's \PCC{}, exception handlers may need to
return via the original unsealed
\PCC{} rather than creating a sentry and similarly forcing the
kernel to re-derive the unsealed capability. In addition to eliminating
unnecessary work, reducing the need for kernels to unseal or re-derive sentry
capabilities in software provides a security benefit by reducing the authority
present in userspace-facing code paths.

Creating sentry capabilities is taken to be an ambient monotonic action,
requiring no additional permission than to have a capability bearing
\cappermX.
%
The \insnref{CSealEntry} instruction derives a sentry capability from any
\cappermX-bearing capability, otherwise preserving permissions, bounds,
and cursor.
%
Sentry capabilities have \cotype{} of $2^{\xlen{}}-2$ (truncated as required by the
implementation; recall \cref{tab:archotypes}) but are not intended to be
unsealable within general system software%
%
\footnote{While it would be ideal if the permission to unseal \cotype{}
$2^{\xlen{}}-2$ (and $2^{\xlen{}}-1$) were excluded from the primordial capability set,
instead, early boot code can enforce this when it partitions its boot
capabilities into the provenance roots it uses in the steady state.}
%
except by entry of control flow.%
%
\footnote{Of course, one could create a `self-unsealing enter capability' that
transferred PCC to the return value (capability) register and then returned
control to the caller.  While this particular gadget is unlikely to be more
than a niche party trick, it demonstrates the need to manage, and (in
particular) clear, capabilities derived from the unsealed PCC before yielding
control.}

CHERI-RISCV-V creates sentry capabilities
whenever it stores the \PCC{} to a link register, as in \insnref{CJALR}.
This behavior furthers our adherence
to the principle of least privilege and reduces the number of ``gadgets''
available to adversarial code.
\jrtcnote{This is a bit dated now; maybe we just remove the first sentence and
glue the second one to another paragraph?}

Because the full, unsealed sentry is installed as the program counter,
PCC-relative addressing permits the invoked instructions to use authority
beyond \cappermX.  We exhibit some examples of such usage below.

\nwfnote{We could
repurpose $\cotype{} = 2^{\xlen{}} - 2$ capabilities lacking \cappermX for some other
use of not-executable capabilities.  Dually, we could say that $\cotype{} = 2^{\xlen{}} - 2$
implies \cappermX and repurpose the bit in the encoding for something
else, should the need arise.}

\subsection{Per-Library Globals Pointers}

Sentry capabilities are useful for multiply instantiated objects (e.g., shared
libraries), as schematically shown in \cref{fig:arch:sentry:plt}.  In this
scenario, we wish to guarantee that any transfer of control into the read-only
region is guaranteed to have a capability to some instance's read-write section
in a register.  In the case of a shared library, this may be a capability to
the library instance's global \texttt{.data} and \texttt{.bss} segments, and so
one sometimes hears the name `globals register' for this register use.  More
generally, the capability may be likened to C++'s \texttt{this}.

In order to achieve the desired effect, the loader should, at instantiation
time, create a Procedure Linkage Table (PLT) per instance; the PLT contains
dedicated trampoline code, together with capabilities to the read-only and
per-instance read-write regions.  For efficiency, we would like the caller to
affect as direct a transfer of control as possible, yet we wish to guard
against frame-shifted entry to the trampoline code.  Moreover, the trampoline
must arrange for the invoked code to have the correct state capability (e.g.,
to a library's global variables), and yet the caller of the library must not
directly hold this capability.  The atomic unseal-and-jump behavior of sentry
capabilities is ideal: the PLT may contain the capability to the state, and the
sentry can authorize its (PCC-relative) load once it has been entered,
yet the user can neither fetch nor manipulate capabilities through the sentry
capability nor enter the instruction stream at an incorrect offset.

\begin{figure} % fig:arch:sentry:plt <<<
\centering
\includegraphics{fig-sentry-plt.pdf}

\caption{PLT-style multiple instantiation showing capability reachability.
The RO region is referenced with a subset of execute and load (data and
capability) permissions by the PLT.  The PLT references its corresponding RW
region with any desired set of permissions.  The PLT is referenced using
sentry capabilities by the outside world.  The RW instance region may also
hold references to the corresponding PLT with additional permissions (dotted
lines); such references are required when the object's methods are not leafs
of the control graph.}
%
\label{fig:arch:sentry:plt}

\end{figure} % >>>

In order to continue to ensure that the code runs with the correct
capability in the globals register after return from a transfer of control
outside the library, re-entry must also be gated by similar PLT stubs.  That
is, the return addresses must themselves be given PLT entries and direct
control transfers must not be used to call out from the library.  Instead,
return addresses (in addition to the usual function entry points) should be
given appropriate PLT stubs and sentry capabilities to those stubs must be
used as the return address given to the callee.

The contents of the stack and register file are otherwise shared with the
callee; the stack may still be visible to the caller, as well.  This
mechanism is therefore not suitable for distrusting inter-domain calls, but
we believe it affords a reasonable amount of control flow integrity
assurance within a domain, acting as a defense against return- or
jump-oriented techniques.

This technique relies very little on architectural mechanism beyond sentry
capabilities, namely, just PCC-relative loads of capabilities.  Moreover, it is
likely simple to explain to a traditional dynamic linker.  However, it requires
dedicated trampolines per instance of the object (library) under study, and
does not completely guarantee control flow: for example, code called by our
sentry-guarded library instance may engage in non-stack-discipline control flow
and skip its return.

\subsection{Environment Calls via Sentry Capabilities}

Sentry capabilities are also useful for sandboxing.  While sandboxed code can
be made to look like a library to the caller, a more
interesting observation is that the reverse is also possible and that sentry
capabilities are also viable for calls \emph{from} the sandbox back to a
single-threaded supervisor environment.  On sandbox construction, the
supervisor allocates space for its state closure (a \texttt{longjmp} buffer
and other state) and builds a set of PLT-like stubs for this
new sandbox that will ensure that a capability to this closure is passed to
the functions invoked, just as the PLT stubs above ensured that the global
pointer is passed.  Whenever the environment calls into the sandbox, it must
update its state closure as part of preparing the register file for entry to
the sandbox.  The return address given to the sandbox should, as discussed
above, also be a sentry capability pointing to one of the constructed
PLT-like stubs.

In the case of multiple threads calling into the sandbox, the environment must
demultiplex its closure pointers, as it cannot necessarily depend on the
sandbox to not use the return sentry capability from one thread within another
thread's execution.  The trampoline code for invoking or returning to the
supervisor environment will, ultimately, involve asking the \emph{supervisor environment's
supervisor} for the notion of `current thread' and using that information to
retrieve the appropriate closure state.  In the case that the environment is
running under a kernel, demultiplexing may avail itself of a system call or
fetch from VDSO to retrieve the current thread identifier or thread local
storage capability.  In the case that the environment \emph{is} the kernel, it
must use privileged architectural state (e.g., a saved stack pointer) to
distinguish threads (and so the sentry capability itself must bear
\cappermASR or have access to another capability that does).

\section{Handling Failures}

Instruction-set architectures have various recourses in the event that a
``failure'' occurs, with common choices being to set special status bits (on
ISAs that have status registers), to write back a special value to a
general-purpose integer register, or to throw an exception.
CHERI introduces several new potential failure modes:

\begin{description}
\item[Instruction-fetch failures] Because the program counter is extended to
  be a capability, it is possible for CHERI to deny access for instruction
  fetch.
  For example, the program counter may move out of bounds, software may
  jump to an untagged or otherwise insufficiently authorized capability, or an
  exception handler may install an untagged or insufficiently authorized
  capability on return.

  We explored two variations on failure reporting: to report the
  failure via an exception at the time that the new program-counter capability
  is installed (e.g., on the jump instruction), or at the time that the
  instruction fetch is requested (i.e., when execution of the new instruction
  is requested).
  Throwing an exception on fetch leads to the most consistent general
  behavior.
  Throwing an exception prior to writing the new value to \PCC{}, on the other
  hand, provides more complete debugging information: the errant jump \PCC{} is
  available to the exception handler.
  With compressed capabilities, this also provides access to the target virtual
  address and fully precise bounds; in the event of a substantially
  out-of-bounds target address, either the target virtual address or the
  bounds would have to be discarded to ensure a representable capability.

  Ultimately, both approaches are consistent with our security goals.
  We therefore err on the side of improved debuggability, throwing exceptions
  on jump where possible.
  We also require checking of capability properties on instruction fetch to
  catch cases such as exception return to an invalid or out-of-bounds
  capability.

\item[Load and store failures] When dereferencing a capability for data
  access occurs, ISAs generally report this failure via an exception at the
  time of the attempted access, which CHERI in general does as well.
  These exceptions fit existing patterns of exception delivery in MMU-based
  architectures and operating systems, which are designed to handle faults on
  memory access.

  There are two cases in which an alternative approach is taken: when the
  \cappermL capability permission or equivalent page-table or TLB
  permission is not present, any tag on the loaded capability is instead
  stripped.
  This avoids an exception that depends on the loaded data value, which is
  awkward in some architectures (e.g., ARMv8-A), but also facilitates writing
  code for tag-stripping memory copies, which arise frequently around
  protection-domain boundaries.

\item[Guarded manipulation failures]
  A new class of register-to-register instructions in CHERI can experience
  failures when attempts are made to violate rules imposed via guarded
  manipulation -- for example, attempts to perform non-monotonic operations, or
  transformations that lead to non-representable bounds with compressed
  capabilities.
  In our initial CHERI-MIPS design, we took the perspective that reporting
  failures early allowed the greatest access to debugging information, and
  favored throwing an exception at the earliest possible point: the
  instruction attempting to violate guarded manipulation.

  Another potential design choice is to instead strip the tag from the value
  being written back to a target capability register, which maintains our
  security safety properties, but defers exception delivery until an attempted
  dereference -- e.g., an instruction load via the resulting invalid
  capability.
  There are two arguments for this latter behavior: first, that some
  architectures by design limit the set of instructions that throw exceptions
  to facilitate superscalar scheduling (e.g., ARMv8-A); and second, that
  exception delivery means that failures that could otherwise be easily
  detected and handled by a compiler or language run time via an explicit tag
  check are now complex to handle.
%%%% STRANGE USAGE.  more difficult to handle?  more complex?

  When using tag stripping in ISAs with status registers (e.g., ARMv8-A), the
  cost of checking results for frequent operations can be amortized via a
  single status check.
  For ISAs without status registers, checking results can come at a
  significant cost, and a deferred exception delivery at time of dereference
  will be the best choice for performance-critical code.

  We therefore make design choices about exception delivery for violations of
  guarded manipulation in a case-by-case basis, taking into account more
  general architectural design philosophies, and also specific use cases where
  software may benefit from tag clearing rather than exception delivery.

%\subsection{Object-Capability Invocation}
%
%\rwnote{A fair amount of this text relates to the software model and not the
%  architectural model -- this should be moved somewhere more appropriate.}
%
%\rwnote{.. But it would be a good idea to have a high-level architectural
%  consideration of non-monotonicity here.  And mention our new thoughts on the
%  CID concept.}
%
%{\em Object invocation} is a central operation in the CHERI ISA, as it
%implements protected subsystem domain transitions that atomically update the
%set of rights (capabilities) held by an architectural thread, and that provide a
%trustworthy return path for later use.
%When an object capability is invoked, its data and code capabilities are
%{\em unsealed} to allow access to per-object instance data and code
%execution.
%Rights may be both acquired and dropped on invocation, allowing non-hierarchical
%security models to be implemented.
%Strong typing and type checking of objects
%in hardware,
%(a notion first introduced in PSOS's {\em type
%enforcement,}~\cite{PSOS,NeumannFeiertag03})
%serves functions both at the ISA level -- providing object
%atomicity despite the use of
%multiple
%independent capabilities to describe an
%object -- and support for language-level type features.
%For example, types can be used to check whether additional object arguments
%passed to a method are as they should be.
%As indicated earlier, the architectural capability type may be used to support
%language-level types, but should not be confused with language-level types.

\section{Composing Architectural Capabilities with ISAs}\label{CAP-ISAs}

In applying CHERI to an architecture, the aim is to impose the key properties
of the abstract CHERI model in a manner keeping with the design philosophy and
approach of each architecture: strong compatibility with MMU-based, C-language
TCBs; strong fine-grained memory protection supporting language properties;
and incrementally deployable, scalable, fine-grained compartmentalization.
This should allow the construction of portable, CHERI-aware software stacks
that have consistent protection properties across a range of underlying
architectures and architectural integration strategies.

ISAs vary substantially in their representation and semantics, but have
certain common aspects:

\begin{itemize}
\item One or more operation encoding (opcode) spaces representing specific
  instructions as fetched from memory;
\item A set of architectural registers managed by a compiler or hand-crafted
  assembly code, which hold intermediate values during computations;
\item Addressable memory, reached via a variety of segmentation and paging
  mechanisms that allow [optional] implementation of virtual addressing;
\item An instruction set allowing memory values to be loaded and stored,
  values to be computed upon, control flow to be manipulated, and so on,
  with respect to both general-purpose integer and floating-point values -- and
  vectors of values for an increasing number of ISAs;
\item An exception mechanism allowing both synchronous exceptions (e.g.,
  originating from instructions such as divide-by-zero, system calls,
  unimplemented instructions, and page-table misses) and asynchronous events
  from outside of the instruction flow (timers, inter-processor interrupts,
  and external I/O interrupts) that cause a controlled transition to a
  supervisor;
\item A set of control instructions or other (perhaps memory-mapped)
  interfaces permitting interaction with the boot environment, management of
  interrupt mechanisms, privileged state, virtual addressing features, timers,
  debugging features, energy management features, and performance-profiling
  features.

  Depending on the architecture, these might be strictly part of the ISA
  (e.g., implemented explicit instructions to flush the TLB, mask
  interrupts, or reset the register state), or they may be part of a broader
  platform definition with precise architectural behavior dependent on the
  specific processor vendor (e.g., having firmware interfaces that flush TLBs
  or control interrupt state, or register values at the start of OS boot
  rather than CPU reset).
\end{itemize}

Implementations of these concepts in different ISAs differ markedly: opcodes
may be of fixed or variable lengths; instructions might strictly separate or
combine memory access and computation; page tables may be a purely software
or architectural constructs; and so on.  Despite these differences in
underlying software representation, a large software corpus (implemented in
both low-level languages (e.g., C, C++) and higher-level managed languages
-- e.g., Java) can be written and maintained in a portable manner across
multiple mainstream architectures.

The CHERI protection model is primarily a transformation of memory access
mechanisms in the instruction set, substituting a richer capability mechanism
for integer pointers used with load and store instructions (as well as
instruction fetch).
However, it has broad impact across all of the above ISA aspects, as it is by
design explicitly integrated with register use (to ensure intentionality of
access) rather than implicit in existing memory access (as is the case with
virtual memory).
CHERI must also integrate with the exception mechanism, as handling an
exception implies a change in effective protection domain, control of
privileged operations such as management of virtual memory, and so on.

As CHERI is applied to an ISA, various low-level design choices must
be made including the storage of capabilities in registers, opcode
encoding, and MMU changes.  These choices are generally specific to
each ISA -- but the objectives achieved through these choices must also appear in
other ISAs implementing the CHERI model: explicit use of capabilities for
addressing relative to virtual-address spaces, monotonicity enforcement via
guarded manipulation, tagged memory protecting valid pointer provenance in
memory, suitable support in the exception mechanism to allow current OS
approaches combining user and kernel virtual-address spaces, and so on.

In the following chapters we present high-level sketches of applications of
the CHERI protection model to two ISAs:
RISC-V (a contemporary load-store instruction
set -- which in many ways is a descendant of the MIPS ISA); and the x86-64 ISA
(which has largely independent lineage of Complex Instruction Set (CISC)
architectures).
The CHERI model applies relatively cleanly to both, with many options
available in how specifically to apply its approach, and yet with a consistent
overall set of implications for software-facing design choices.
Wherever possible, we aim to support the same operating-system, language,
compiler, run-time, and application protection and security benefits, which
will be represented differently in machine code and low-level software
support, but be largely indistinguishable from a higher-level programming
perspective.

It is possible to imagine less tight integration of CHERI's features with the
instruction set.
Microcontrollers, for example, are subject to tighter constraints on area and
power, and yet might benefit from the use of capabilities when sharing memory
with software running on a fully CHERI-integrated application processor.
For example, a microcontroller might perform DMA on behalf of a CHERI-compiled
application, and therefore desire to constrain its access to those possible
through capabilities provided by the application.
In this scenario, a less complete integration might serve the purposes of that
environment, such as by providing a small number of special capability
registers sufficient to perform capability-based loads and stores, or to
perform tag-preserving memory copies, but not intended to be used for the
majority of general-purpose operations in a small, fixed-purpose program for
which strong static checking or proof of correctness may be possible.

\subsection{Architectural Privilege}

In operating-system design, {\em privileges} are a special set of rights
exempting a component from the normal protection and access-control models --
perhaps for the purposes of system bootstrapping, system management, or
low-level functionality such as direct hardware access.
In CHERI, three notions of privilege are defined, complementing current
notions of architectural privilege:

\begin{description}

\item[Ring-based privilege] derives from the widely used architectural notion
  that code executes within a \textit{ring}, typically indicated by the state
  of a privileged status register, authorizing access to architectural protection
  features such as MMU configuration or interrupt management.
  Code executing in lower rings, such as a microkernel, hypervisor, or full
  operating-system kernel, has the ability to manage state giving it control
  over state in higher, but not lower, rings.
  When a privileged operation is attempted in a higher ring, an architectural
  exception will typically be thrown, allowing a supervisor to emulate the
  operation, or handle this as an error by delivering a signal or terminating
  a process.
  More recent hardware architectures allow privileged operations to be
  virtualized, improving the performance of full-system virtualization in
  which code that would historically have run in the lowest ring (i.e., the OS
  kernel) now runs over a hypervisor.

  CHERI retains and extends this notion of privilege into the capability
  model: when an unauthorized operation is performed (such as attempting to
  expand the rights associated with a capability), the processor will throw an
  exception and transition control to a lower ring.
  The exception mechanism itself is modified in CHERI, in order to save and
  restore the capability register state required within the execution of each
  ring -- to authorize appropriate access for the exception handler.
  The lower ring may hold the privilege to perform the operation, and emulate
  the unauthorized operation, or perform exception-handling operations such
  as delivering a signal to (or terminating) the user process.

\item[Capability control of ring-related privileges] refers to limitations
  that can be placed on ring-related privileges using the capability model.
  Normally, code executing in lower protection rings (e.g., the supervisor) has
  access to privileged functions, such as MMU, cache, and interrupt
  management, by virtue of ambient authority.
  CHERI permits that ambient authority to be constrained via capability
  permissions on the \textit{program-counter capability}, preventing less
  privileged code (still executing within a low ring) from exercising
  virtual-memory features that might allow bypassing of in-kernel sandboxing.
  More generally, this allows vulnerability mitigation by requiring
  explicit (rather than implicit) exercise of privilege, as individual
  functions can be marked as able to exercise those features, with other
  kernel code unable to do so.
\end{description}

These models can be composed in a variety of ways.
For example, if a compartmentalization model is implemented in userspace over
a hybrid kernel, the kernel might choose to accept system calls from only
suitably privileged compartments within userspace -- such as by requiring
those compartments to have a specific software-defined permission set on their
program-counter capability.

\subsubsection{Layering Software Privilege over Capability Privilege}

In addition to these purely architectural views of privilege, privileged
software (e.g., the OS kernel running in supervisor mode) is able to
selectively proxy access to architectural privilege via system calls.
This facility is used extensively in contemporary designs.
For example, requests to memory
map files or anonymous memory, after processing by many levels of abstraction,
lead to page-table updates, TLB flushes, and so on.
Similarly, requests to configure in-process signal timers or time out I/O
events, many levels of abstraction lower, are translated into operations to
manage hardware timers and interrupts.

Similar structures can be implemented using the CHERI capability model.
\textbf{Privilege through capability context} is a new, and more general,
notion of privilege arising solely from the capability model, based on a set of
rights held by an execution context connoting privilege within an address
space.
When code begins executing within a new address space, it will frequently be
granted full control over that address space, with initial capabilities that
allow it to derive any required code, data, and object capabilities it might
require.
This notion of privilege is fully captured by the capability model, and no
recourse is required to a lower ring as part of privilege management in this
sense.
This approach follows the spirit of Paul Karger's paper on limiting the
damage potential of discretionary Trojan horses~\cite{Karger87}, and extends
it further.
Certain operations, such as domain transition, do employ the ring mechanism,
in order to represent controlled privilege escalation -- e.g., via the
object-capability call and return instructions.

\subsection{Traps, Interrupts, and Exception Handling}
\label{sec:traps_interrupts_exception_handling}

CHERI retains and extends existing architectural exception support, as
triggered by traps, system calls, and interrupts.
CHERI affects the situations in which exceptions are triggered, and changes
aspects of exception delivery, state management within exceptions, and also
exception return.
Exception handling is also one of the means by which non-monotonic state
transition takes place: as exception handlers are entered, they gain access to
capabilities unavailable to general execution, allowing them to implement
mechanisms such as domain transition to more privileged compartments.
As exception support varies substantially by architecture -- how exception
handlers are registered, what context is saved and restored, and so on --
CHERI integration necessarily varies substantially.
However, certain general principles apply regardless of the specific
architecture.

\subsubsection{New Exceptions for Existing and New Instructions}

New exception opportunities are introduced for both existing and new
instructions, which may trap if insufficient rights are held, or an invalid
operation is requested.
For example:

\begin{itemize}
\item Instruction fetch may trap if it attempts to fetch an instruction in a
  manner not authorized by the installed Program-Counter Capability (\PCC{}).

\item Existing integer-relative load and store instructions will trap if they
  attempt to access memory locations in a manner not authorized by the
  installed Default Data Capability (\DDC{}).

\item New capability-relative load and store instructions will trap if they
  attempt to access memory locations in a manner not authorized by the
  explicitly presented capability.

\item New capability-manipulation instructions may trap if they violate
  guarded-manipulation rules, such as by attempting to increase the bounds on
  a capability.
\end{itemize}

\noindent
In general, CHERI attempts to provide useful cause information when exceptions
fire, including to identify whether an exception was triggered by using an
invalid capability, dereferencing a sealed capability, or an access request
not being authorized by capability permissions or bounds (see
Section~\ref{sec:capability_exception_causes} for details).

\subsubsection{Exception Delivery}

The details of exception delivery vary substantially by architecture; however,
CHERI adaptations are in general fairly consistent across architectures:

\paragraph{Interrupt state}
Interrupts will typically be disabled on exception entry.
System software will typically leave interrupts disabled during low-level
processing, but re-enable interrupts so as to allow preemption during normal
kernel operation.
CHERI does not change this behavior.

\paragraph{Control-flow state}
The Program Counter (\PC{}) will be saved in
architecture-specific state (for example, in a special register).
System status state, such as the ring in which the interrupted code was
executing, as well as possibly other state such as interrupt masks, will be
saved in an architecture-specific manner.
System software will typically save this and any other register state
associated with the preempted code, allowing to to establish a full execution
context for the exception handler, or to switch to another thread.
CHERI extends \PC{} to become a Program-Counter Capability
(\PCC{}) and must save a copy of \PCC{} and not just \PC{}.
Depending on the architecture, status registers may be extended to also
contain CHERI-related information, such as whether opcode interpretation for
loads and stores is integer relative or capability relative (as in
CHERI-RISC-V), allowing that state to differ between interrupted code and the
exception handler.

\paragraph{Other architectural state}
In addition to general-purpose registers, architectures may provide access to
a set of special registers, such as for Thread-Local Storage (TLS).
Additional context banking or saving may also occur, to facilitate fast
exception delivery.
For example, in ARMv8-A, the stack pointer register is banked, allowing
exception handlers to use their own stack pointer to save remaining registers.
In x86-64, the stack pointer register is potentially replaced and the original
stack pointer is saved on the exception stack.
CHERI extensions are also required to these additional pieces of
architectural context management; for example, TLS integer registers must be
extended to become TLS capabilities.
The banked ARMv8-A stack pointer and x86-64 exception stack pointers
would need to be widened to full capabilities.

\paragraph{Exception-handler entry}
In order to execute an exception handler, the architecture will switch to an
appropriate ring (often the supervisor ring), and set \PC{} to the address of
the desired exception vector.
Exception delivery may also change other aspects of execution, such 32-bit
vs. 64-bit execution, so as to enter the exception handler in the execution
mode that is expected.
CHERI extensions are required to provide a suitable \PCC{} and
exception data capability to provide additional rights to the
exception handler authorizing its execution.
CHERI-RISC-V provides this by extending the \xtvec{} special registers
and adding the \xtdc{} and \xscratch{} special capability registers.

\subsubsection{Safe exception state handling}

In some architectures, partial register banking or reserved exception-only
registers mean that exception handlers must utilize only a subset of
registers unless they explicitly save them.
With CHERI, it is essential that capability register values not just be saved
and restored, to ensure correct functionality, but that capability register
values are also not leaked, as this may undesirably grant privilege.
For example, even if the ABI does not require that a system call or trap
maintain the values of certain registers over exception handling, the
exception handler must restore or clear those values to ensure that
capabilities used by the exception handler or another context are not leaked.

\subsubsection{Exception Return}

Exception return unwinds the effects described in the previous section,
restoring \PC{}, restoring the saved ring and interrupt-enable
state, swapping banked registers, and so on.
The changes made to support CHERI exception entry must also be made to
exception return, such as restoring the full \PCC{}.

\subsubsection{Capability Exception Causes}
\label{sec:capability_exception_causes}

In each of the target ISAs (RISC-V and x86-64), we introduce a new
exception to report capability violations.
Since this exception covers a variety of error cases, each CHERI ISA
must provide a capability exception code in an architecture-specific
manner which indicates the specific violation.
While the capability exception code delivery is architecture-specific,
the capability exception codes are shared across all architectures.
The possible capability exception codes are shown in Table~\ref{table:capability-cause}.

\label{table:capability-cause}
\end{table}

\subsubsection{Capability Exception Priority}
\label{sec:capability_exception_priority}

Exception handling in most architectures involves an architectural cause code
that describes the type of event that triggered the exception -- for example,
indicating that a trap has been caused by a read or write page fault.
Exception types are prioritized so that if more than one exception code could
be delivered -- e.g., there is the potential for both an alignment fault and
also a page fault triggered by a particular load or store -- a single cause is
consistently reported.

Capability-triggered exceptions in general have a high priority, above that
for either alignment faults or MMU-related faults (such as page-table or TLB
misses), as capability processing logically occurs ``before'' a virtual
address is interpreted.
This also prevents undesirable (or potentially insecure) behaviors, such as
the ability to trigger a page fault on a virtual address outside the bounds of
a capability being dereferenced: instead, the bounds error should be reported.
Similarly, if an operating system implements emulation of unaligned loads and
stores by catching unaligned-access exceptions, having capability checks occur
in preference to alignment exceptions avoids having alignment emulation also
perform capability checks -- e.g., of its length or permissions.
Other priority rules are less security critical, but are defined by this
specification so that exception processing is deterministic.
Each architecture defines its own exception priority, and
architecture-specific instantiations of CHERI must define an
architecture-specific prioritization for capability-related exceptions
relative to other exception types.

If an instruction could potentially throw more than one capability exception,
the capability exception code is set to the highest priority exception (numerically lowest
priority value) as shown in Table~\ref{table:exception-priority}.

\begin{table}

\subsection{Virtual Memory}
\label{sec:virtual_memory}

Where virtual memory is present and enabled, CHERI capabilities are
interpreted with respect to the current virtual address space.
In architectures, such as CHERI-RISC-V, where virtual-address translation can be
enabled or disabled dynamically, the embedded address in a capability will be interpreted as a
physical address when translation is disabled, and a virtual address when
virtual addressing is enabled.

Capabilities do not embed Address-Space IDentifiers (ASIDs), and so will be
interpreted relative to the current virtual address space; this means that,
as with virtual addresses themselves, the interpretation of a specific
capability value depends on the address space that they are used in.
The operating system or other TCBs may wish to limit the flow of capabilities
between address spaces for this reason.

Processing of capabilities is therefore ``before'' virtual-address
translation, with the result of each memory access via a capability being an
access control decision (allow or reject the access) and a virtual address and
length for the authorized operation.
The operation then proceeds through the normal memory access paths for
instruction fetch, load, or store.
The capability mechanism therefore never enables new operations not already
supported by existing MMU-based checks.

\subsubsection{Authorizing MMU Control}

Modern Memory Management Units (MMUs) support architectural page tables.
A series of instructions or control registers
configures parameters such as the page-table format being used and the current
page-table root, and can selectively or fully flush the Translation
Look-aside Buffer (TLB).
The page table has an architecturally defined format, consisting of a
multi-level tree of Page-Table Directory Entries (PTDEs) and leaf-node
Page-Table Entries (PTEs), and may not only be read but also written to if
dirty or access bits are supported.
The architecture will perform a series of memory reads to locate the correct
page-table entry to satisfy a lookup, filling a largely microarchitectural
TLB.
Exceptions may fire if operations are rejected as a result of
page permission checks (e.g., an attempt to store to a read-only page).
CHERI composes with these mechanisms in several ways:

\begin{itemize}
\item CHERI controls use of privileged instructions and control registers that
  configure the MMU, including enabling and disabling translation, configuring
  a page-table root, and flushing the TLB.
  The \cappermASR* permission must be present on \PCC{} to perform these
  operations.

\item CHERI currently
  \textit{does not} control memory accesses performed by the walker via
  physical addresses.
  In a more ideal future world, the page-table walker would be given an
  initial, likely physical, capability to use as the root, and have further
  access authorized by capabilities embedded in page-table directory entries.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{MMU Capability Permissions}

Virtual-address translation is itself unmodified, but permission checking is
extended with new page permissions in the MMU mappings (i.e., PTEs):

\begin{description}
\item[MMU Load Capability Permission]
If this permission is present, as well as the existing page-table read
permission, then loading tagged capabilities is permitted.
If this permission is not present, architectures may either trap or
clear the tag bit of the loaded capability.

If the \cappermLC permission is not present on the authorizing capability for
the memory read, then the tag is cleared from the loaded capability, and this
page permission is ignored.

If an exception is raised, the exception should resemble other MMU
exceptions for the architecture.  In particular, the virtual address
of the attempted memory access should be provided by the exception in
a similar manner to other MMU exceptions.

As both trapping and tag-clearing semantics might be useful in different
circumstances, architectures may use a separate
bit in the MMU mapping to indicate which behavior is requested.
It is possible to emulate the tag-clearing semantics given only the trapping
semantics, at the cost of efficiency; if trapping semantics are
desired but the architecture only permits a single semantic (e.g. due
to limited MMU mapping bits), we suggest providing only the trapping behavior.

While traps would ideally only be
raised if a \emph{set} tag were returned from memory, this would be a
\emph{data-dependent trap}, a potentially uncomfortable proposition for
high-performance microarchitectures.  Instead, we believe it permissible for a
(micro)architecture to always trap on capability load instructions fetching
through MMU mappings without this permission.  System software could
minimize spurious traps for capability-oblivious code such as memory
copies by using capabilities without the \cappermLC permission for
mappings lacking this permission.

\item[MMU Store Capability Permission]
If this permission is present, as well as the existing page-table write
permission, then storing tagged capabilities is permitted.
Otherwise, if a capability store operation occurs with a capability value that
has the tag bit set, an exception will be thrown.

If an exception is raised, the exception should resemble other MMU
exceptions for the architecture.  In particular, the virtual address
of the attempted memory access should be provided by the exception in
a similar manner to other MMU exceptions.

With the page-table store-capability permission, it is also imaginable that
the architecture might choose to strip the tag bit before performing the
store, rather than throw an exception, if the permission is required but not
present.
This would avoid a data-dependent exception, which may simplify the
microarchitecture.
However, this would disallow the dynamic tracking of possible capability
locations using this permission bit, in a manner similar to emulated dirty
page support.
As this support may be important in improving performance for revocation and
garbage collection, it would be desirable to provide some other mechanism in
that case.
\end{description}

\subsubsection{Capability Dirty Bit}

In architectures that support tracking dirty pages in the page table, by
performing updates to page-table entries when a page has been dirtied, it is
imaginable that a new \textit{capability dirty bit} might provide a suitable
substitute for trapping on a failed capability store.
This bit would be set atomically if a new tagged capability value is stored
via the page.
In as much as the architecture supported false positives for the page dirty
bit -- i.e., that the dirty bit could be set even though there wasn't a
committed data write -- that would also be permissible for the capability
dirty bit.
However, false negatives -- in which the dirty bit is not set despite the
page becoming dirty -- would not be permissible for the capability dirty bit.
Otherwise, there is a risk that revocation or garbage collection might
``miss'' a capability, violating a temporal security or safety policy.

\subsubsection{Per-Page Capability Load Barriers}
\label{section:capability-load-barriers}

Garbage collectors and capability revocation, in addition to lazily tracking
capability flow through stores, would like to be able to catch (attempted)
capability transfers on loads from memory.  Such software could avail itself of
the trapping variant of the page-table load capability permission, in
which loading a (tagged) capability \emph{trapped}.

Across an application's lifetime, its address space may need to be repeatedly
scanned.  That is, its capability-bearing pages may need to transition in
tandem between permitting capability loads and trapping thereupon to cue the
collector or revoker's inspection of the source page before restoring that page
to permitting capability loads.  While it is certainly possible to update all
MMU mappings to toggle between the two, this operation would take linear time
and touch linear memory, likely with all application threads paused.  We
instead envision a parallel constant-time operation for the bulk update,
achieved by equipping each \emph{CPU core} and all MMU mappings with one-bit
``generation counters'' delimiting per-address-space ``epochs.'' Prior to the
start of an epoch, all generation counters within the address space's page
tables and actively associated cores are equal.  The beginning of an epoch is
signaled by all cores incrementing their generation (synchronously, from the
perspective of the application), and the epoch comes to an end when all MMU
mappings' generation counters once again equal this incremented value.

\nwfnote{fwref experimental appendix on CLGs, once that's ready}

\subsubsection{Memory Compression, Memory Encryption, Swapping, and Migration}

When memory pages are stored to a non-tag-bearing medium, such as by virtue
of being compressed in DRAM, encrypted, swapped, or perhaps migrated to
another system by virtue of process or virtual-machine migration, tags must
also be saved and restored.
Architecturally, this can be performed by reading through the page of memory,
checking for tags, and preserving them out-of-band -- e.g., in a swap
meta-data structure.
They can then be restored by rederiving the capability value from some
suitably privileged authorizing capability.
We offer specific instructions to support efficiently restoring tags without
software inspecting the in-memory format: \insnref{CBuildCap} and
\insnref{CCSeal}.
\insnref{CLoadTags} allows efficient gathering of tag data from full
cache lines, and has non-temporal behavior -- i.e., will not perform
cache allocation, despite being coherent, to avoid sweeping passes pulling
all the corresponding data into the cache.
It is imaginable that a \insnnoref{CStoreTags} instruction might be
desirable to set tags bulk, but this would require some care with privilege to
avoid an arbitrary \insnnoref{CSetTag} implementation rather than
controlled rederivation.

\subsection{Direct Memory Access (DMA)}
\label{sec:dma}

As described in this chapter, the CHERI capability model is a property of the
instruction-set architecture of the CPU, and imposed on code executing on that
CPU.
However, in most computer systems, Direct Memory Access (DMA) is used by
non-application cores, accelerators, and peripheral devices to transfer data
into and out of system memory without explicit instruction execution for each
byte transferred: device drivers configure and start DMA using device or
DMA-engine control registers, and then await completion notification through
an interrupt or by polling.
Used in isolation, nothing about the CHERI ISA implies that device memory
access would be constrained by capabilities.

\subsubsection{DMA Stores with Tag Stripping}

Our first recommendation is that, in the absence of additional support, DMA
access to memory be unable to write tagged values, and that it implicitly
strip tags associated with stored memory locations as all writes will be data
and not capabilities.
This implements a conservative model in which only the CPU is able to
introduce capabilities into the system, and DMA stores do not risk errantly
(or maliciously) introducing capabilities without valid provenance, or
corrupting CPU-originated capabilities-- as all such writes will involve data and
not capabilities.

\subsubsection{Capability-Aware DMA and IOMMUs}

Our second recommendation is that ``capability-aware DMA'' -- i.e., DMA that
can load and store tagged values -- be the remit of only trustworthy DMA
engines that will preserve valid provenance, ensure monotonicity, and so on.
As with capabilities on general-purpose CPUs, capabilities must be evaluated
with respect to an address space.
In the event that no IOMMU is present, this will be a (possibly ``the'')
physical address space.
With an IOMMU, this will be one of potentially many I/O virtual address
spaces.
As with multiple virtual address spaces on an MMU-enabled general-purpose CPU,
care will need to be taken to ensure that capabilities can be used only in
address spaces where they have appropriate meaning.

There is a more general question about the \textit{reachability} of all
capabilities: a general-purpose OS can reasonably be expected to find all
available capabilities through awareness of architectural registers and
tag-enabled memory, for the purposes of revocation or garbage collection.
Capabilities held by devices will require additional work to locate or
revoke, and will likely require awareness of the specific device.
This is an area for further research.

\subsection{Caching and Explicit Prefetch}
\label{sec:caching-and-explicit-prefetch}

Some architectures have explicit
prefetch instructions that give a hint to the CPU that data at a particular
virtual address might be used in the near future. For performance reasons,
these prefetch instructions do not raise MMU exceptions. This allows a highly
parallel CPU implementation to start executing the next instruction in the program
without waiting for the TLB check to complete. (Imagine, for example, that
a prefetch is followed by a store to a different address). For similar performance
reasons, with CHERI a \DDC{}-relative prefetch instruction may fail without raising
an exception if the address is outside the range of \DDC{}. On the other hand,
there is a potential covert timing channel if programs are allowed to prefetch
memory addresses to which they do not have access. If a prefetch to the out of
bounds address changed the contents of the memory caches, then another subprogram
(one that did have a capability granting access to the memory address) could
test whether or not the prefetch had happened by doing a load and timing how
long it took. The compromise between performance and security is that prefetch
of an out of bounds address does not raise an exception, but also does not
change the memory caches or (in multicore CPUs) affect the behavior of other cores;
it acts like a no-op.

Prefetch will typically fetch an entire cache line, not just the address that
has been explicitly prefetched. The question then arises as to what happens
if \DDC{} grants access to the address that is explicitly prefetched, but not
all of the cache line. As prefetch does not raise an exception on failure, it
can silently fail in this case without affecting program correctness (though
there will be a performance penalty). If covert
channels via memory caches are a concern, subsystems that are intended to be
isolated should not share cache lines: ordinary loads, and load-linked/store conditional
also provide opportunities for covert channels via caches. Rounding up a protected subsystem's
memory region to a cache line boundary will mean that the reduced performance case
where part of the cache line is outside the range of \DDC{} will not be encountered.

To allow explicit prefetch in pure capability mode, a prefetch via capability
instruction may also be added. The security and performance trade-offs are
the same as for prefetch relative to \DDC{}: an out of bounds prefetch can fail
silently without raising an exception, as long as it does not perturb the
memory caches.

\section{Implications for Software Models and Code Generation}

\subsection{C and C++ Language and Code Generation Models}

CHERI capabilities are an architectural primitive that can be used in a
variety of ways to support different aspects of software robustness.
This is especially true because of CHERI's hybrid approach, which supports
incremental deployment within both source languages and code generation.
We have explored three different C and C++ language models:

\begin{description}
\item[Pure Integer Pointers] In this C-language variant, all pointers are
  assumed to be implemented as integer virtual addresses.

\item[Hybrid Pointers] In this C-language variant, pointers may be implemented
  as integer virtual addresses or as capabilities depending on language-level
  types or other annotations.
  While we have primarily explored the use of a simple qualifier,
  \ccode{__capability}, which indicates that a pointer type should be
  implemented as a capability, a variety of other mechanisms can or could be
  used.
  For example, policy for the use of capabilities might be dictated by binary
  compatibility constraints: public APIs and ABIs for a library might utilize
  integer pointers, but all internal implementation might use capabilities.

\item[Pure-Capability Pointers] In this C-language variant, all pointers are
  implemented as capabilities.
\end{description}

Alongside these language-level models, we have also developed a set of binary
code-generation and binary interface conventions regarding software-managed
capabilities.
These are similar to those used in non-capability designs, including features
such as caller-save and callee-save registers, a stack pointer, etc.
We have explored three different Application Binary Interfaces (ABIs) that
utilize capabilities to varying degrees:

\begin{description}
\item[Native ABI] The native ABI(s) for the architecture: capability registers
  and capability instructions are unused.
  Generated code relies on CHERI compatibility features to interpret integer
  pointers with respect to the program-counter and default-data capabilities.

\item[Hybrid ABI] Capability-aware code makes selective use of capability
  registers and instructions, but can transparently interoperate with Native ABI
  code when capability arguments or return values are unused.
  The programmer may annotate pointers or types to indicate that data pointers
  should be implemented in terms of capabilities; the compiler and linker may
  be able utilize capabilities in further circumstances, such as for pointers
  that do not escape a scope, or are known to pass to other hybrid code.
  They may also use capabilities for other addresses or values used in
  generated code, such as to protect return addresses or for on-stack
  canaries.
  The goal of this ABI is binary compatibility with, where requested by the
  programmer, additional protection.
  This is used within hybrid applications or libraries to provide selective
  protection for key allocations or memory types, as well as interoperability
  with pure-capability compartments.

\item[Pure-Capability ABI] Capabilities are used for all language-level
  pointers, but also underlying addresses in the run-time environment, such as
  return addresses.
  The goal of this ABI is strong protection at significant cost to binary
  interoperability.
  This is used for both compartmentalized code, and also pure-capability
  (``CheriABI'') applications.
\end{description}

\subsection{Object Capabilities}

\rwnote{This section is a bit out-of-place here, and relates more to the
  software model -- but we do need to talk about this somewhere after the
  basic architecture is defined.  This text is also a bit out-of-date given
  our exception-free CCall.}

As noted above, the CHERI design calls for two forms of capabilities:
capabilities that describe regions of memory and offer bounded-buffer
``segment'' semantics, and object capabilities that permit the
implementation of protected subsystems.
In our model, object capabilities are represented by a pair of sealed
code and data capabilities, which provide the necessary information to implement
a protected subsystem domain transition.
Object capabilities are ``invoked'' using the \insnref{CInvoke} instruction.

In traditional capability designs, invocation of an object capability triggered microcode
responsible for state management.
Initially, we implemented a pair of \insnnoref{CCall} and
\insnnoref{CReturn} instructions via software exception
handlers in the kernel, but have since refined this model to a single \insnref{CInvoke} which
performs a jump-like operation to minimize overhead.
In the longer term, we hope to investigate the congruence of object-capability invocation with message-passing primitives between architectural threads: if each register
context represents a security domain, and one domain invokes a service offered by
another domain, passing a small number of general-purpose integer and capability
registers, then message passing may offer a way to provide significantly enhanced
performance.\footnote{This appears to be another instance of the isomorphism
between explicit message passing and shared memory design.  If we introduce
hardware message passing, then it will in fact blend aspects of both models and
use the explicit message-passing primitive to cleanly isolate the two contexts,
while still allowing shared arguments using pointers to common storage, or
delegation using explicit capabilities.  This approach would allow application
developers additional flexibility for optimization.}
In this view, architectural thread contexts, or register files, are simply caches of thread
state to be managed by the processor.

Significant questions then arise regarding rendezvous: how can messages be
constrained so that they are delivered only as required, and what are the interactions
regarding scheduling?
While this structure
might appear more efficient than a TLB (by virtue of
not requiring objects with multiple names to appear multiple times), it still requires an
efficient lookup structure (such as a TCAM).
\nwfnote{What for?}

In either instantiation, a number of design challenges arise.
How can we ensure safe invocation and return behavior?
How can callers safely delegate arguments by reference for the duration of the
call to bound the period of retention of a capability by a callee (which is
particularly important if arguments from the call stack are passed by reference)?

How should stacks themselves be handled in this light, since a single
logical stack will arguably be reused by many different security
domains, and it is undesirable that one domain in execution might
`pop' rights from another domain off of the stack, or reuse a
capability to access memory previously used as a call-by-reference
argument.

These concerns argue for at least three features: a logical stack spanning many
stack fragments bound to individual security domains, a fresh source of ephemeral
stacks ready for reuse, and some notion of a do-not-transfer facility in order to
prevent the further propagation of a capability (perhaps implemented via a
revocation mechanism, but other options are readily apparent).  PSOS explored
similar notions of propagation-limited capabilities with similar motivations.

\section{Deep Versus Surface Design Choices}
\label{sec:deep-vs-surface}

\rwnote{Some things to add here: A few more details on compression formats
  and variance within the ones we've defined; a bit more on domain
  transition; temporal-safety mechanisms; example instruction list; global/
  local capabilities; composition with privilege/rings; other things?}

In adapting an ISA to implement the CHERI protection model, we find it useful
to contrast between two types of changes:

\begin{description}
\item[Deep design choices] include the decision to expose capability use and
  management for explicit use by the compiler, employing tagged memory to
  protect capability values, enforcing monotonicity using limitations on the
  instruction set, preventing capability use if its valid provenance has been
  violated, and introducing (or extending) registers (including control
  registers such as the Program Counter) to hold capability values.

\item[Surface design choices] reflect to the specific possible integrations
  with the target ISA, including the specific blend of instructions and their
  encodings, whether the address embedded in a capability is physical or
  virtual, how to extend existing registers to hold capability values,
  the specific number (or mix) of
  capability registers, and whether violations of capability provenance or
  monotonicity are prevented by an exception being thrown or the tag on the
  target of an operation being cleared.
\end{description}

Further, applications to an ISA are necessarily sensitive to existing choices
in the ISA -- for example, how page tables are represented in the
instruction set, and the means by which exception delivery takes place.
In general, the following aspects of CHERI are fundamental design decisions
that it is desirable to retain in applying CHERI concepts in any ISA:

\begin{itemize}
\item Capabilities can be used to implement pointers into virtual address
  spaces (or physical address spaces for processors without virtual memory,
  or with virtual memory disabled).
\item Tags on registers or in memory determine whether they are valid
  capabilities for loading, fetching, or jumping to;
\item Tagged registers can contain both data
  and capabilities, allowing (for example) capability-oblivious memory copies;
\item Tags on capability-sized, capability-aligned units of memory preserve
  validity (or invalidity) across loads and stores to memory;
\item Tags are associated with physical memory locations -- i.e., if
  the same physical memory is mapped at two different virtual addresses, the
  same tags will be used;
\item Attempts to store data (rather than a valid capability) into memory that
  has one or more valid tags will atomically clear the tags on any affected
  memory;
\item Capability loads and stores to memory offer strong atomicity with
  respect to capability values and tags preventing race
conditions
  that might yield
  combinations of different capability values, or the tag remaining set when
  a corrupted capability is reloaded;
\item Capabilities contain bounds and permissions; a capability's address is
  able to float freely within (and to varying extents, beyond) the bounds;
\item Permissions control both data and control-flow operations;
\item Guarded manipulation in the architecture (and, implicitly, microarchitecture) implements monotonicity: rights can be reduced but
  not increased through valid manipulations of capabilities;
\item Invalid manipulations of capabilities violating guarded-manipulation rules
  lead to an exception or clearing of the valid tag, whether in a register or
  in memory, with suitable atomicity;
\item Loads via, stores via, and jumps to capabilities are constrained by their
  permissions and bounds, throwing exceptions on a violation -- for jumps,
  this could be on the jump instruction, or on instruction fetch at the
  target;
\item Capability exceptions, in general, are delivered with greater priority
  than MMU exceptions;
\item Permissions on capabilities include the ability to not just control
  loading and storing of data, but also loading and storing of capabilities;
\item Capability-unaware loads, stores, and jump operations via integer
  pointers are constrained by implied capabilities such as the Default Data
  Capability and Program Counter Capability, ensuring that legacy code is
  constrained;
\item If present, the Memory Management Unit (MMU) via
  extensions to the page-table entries for hardware-managed TLBs, contains
  additional permissions controlling the loading and storing of capabilities;
\item That MMU-enforced permissions may clear tags or throw exceptions if
  violated (possibly as configurable option);
\item C-language compatibility is maintained through definitions of
  NULL to be untagged, zero-filled memory, instructions to convert between
  capabilities and integer pointers, and instructions providing C-compatible
  equality operators;
\item Reserved capabilities in special registers
  allow a software supervisor to operate with greater rights
  than non-supervisor code, recovering those rights on exception delivery;
\item A capability flow-control model to allow the propagation of
  capabilities to be constrained, preventing capabilities marked as local
  from being stored via capabilities marked to prevent that;
\item Sealed capabilities allow a non-monotonic escalation of privilege
  associated with a constrained control-flow transition to a defined address.
  Subject to the use of suitable instructions, and appropriate permissions, a
  pair of sealed capabilities with identical object types allow access to
  unsealed versions of the capabilities, with code beginning execution at one
  of them.
  This enables software-enabled behaviors such as software
  compartmentalization.
\item Sealed entry capabilities likewise allow non-monotonic escalation of
  privilege associated with a constrained control-flow transition to a
  defined address.
  Subject to use of suitable instructions, and appropriate permissions, a
  single sealed entry (sentry) capability allows code to begin execution via
  an unsealed version of the same capability.
\item By clearing architecture-defined permissions, and utilizing software-defined
  permissions, capabilities can be used to represent spaces other than the
  virtual address space;
\item For compressed capabilities, addresses can stray well out-of-bounds
  without becoming unrepresentable;
\item For compressed capabilities, alignment requirements do not
  restrict common object sizes and do not overly restrict large objects beyond
  common limitations of allocators and virtual memory mapping; and
\item That through inductive properties of the instruction set, from the
  point of CPU reset, via guarded manipulation, and suitable firmware and
  software management, it is not possible to ``forge'' capabilities or
  otherwise escalate privilege other than as described by this model and
  explicit exercise of privilege (e.g., via saved exception-handler
  capabilities, unsealing, etc).
\end{itemize}

The following design choices are associated with our specific integrations of
the CHERI model into the 32/64-bit RISC-V and x86-64 ISAs, and might be
revisited in various forms in integrating CHERI support into these or other
ISAs:

\begin{itemize}
\item The number of capability registers present;
\item How capability-related permissions on MMU pages are indicated;
\item How capabilities representing escalated privilege for exception
  handlers are stored;
\item Whether specific capability-related failures (in particular, operations
  violating guarded manipulation) lead to an immediate exception, or simply
  clearing of the tag and a later exception on use;
\item How tags are stored in the memory subsystem -- e.g., whether close to
  the DRAM they protect or in a partition of memory -- as long as they are
  presented with suitable protections and atomicity up the memory hierarchy;
\item How the instruction-set opcode space is utilized -- e.g., via
  coprocessor reservations in the opcode space, reuse of existing instructions
  controlled by a mode, etc;
\item What addressing modes are supported by instructions -- e.g., whether
  instructions accept only a capability operand as the base address, perhaps
  with immediates, or whether they also accept integer operands via
  non-capability (or untagged) registers; and
\item The specific parameter choices in capability values, including the
  number of dereferenceable bits in the address, the investment of bits in
  bounds-related fields (such as the exponent size), the size of the
  object-type field, the number of software-defined permissions, and also the
  specific in-memory layout.
\item How capabilities are represented microarchitecturally -- e.g.,
  compressed or decompressed if compression is used; if the base and offset
  are stored pre-computed as a cursor rather than requiring additional
  arithmetic on dereference; or whether an object-type field is present for
  non-sealed in-memory representations.

\section{Potential Future Changes to the CHERI Architecture}

The following changes have been discussed and are targeted for short-term
implementation in the CHERI architecture:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Define the values of base, length, and offset for compressed
  capabilities with $\cexponent{} > 43$, where the formulas for
  decompressing base and top do not make sense due to bit indexes
  being out of bounds.  This is possible for the default capability
  (defined to have $length = 2^{64}$, although $\cexponent{}$ is
  unspecified) and untagged data loaded from memory. One proposed
  behavior is to treat all untagged compressed capabilities as though
  they have $base=0$ and $length=2^{64}$ for the purposes of the
  instructions where this matters, namely \insnref{CGetBase},
  \insnref{CGetOffset}, \insnref{CIncOffset},
  \insnref{CGetLen} and \insnref{CSub}.
  However, there is also a desire that \insnref{CSetOffset} should preserve
    the values of $T$ and $B$ for debugging purposes, where possible.

\item
  Consider re-writing pseudocode in terms of absolute addresses rather
  than offsets, without changing the semantics. This would eliminate
  repeated use of \cbase{} $+$ \coffset{} to mean the address field of the
  capability; it would also potentially reduce ambiguity such as where
  \cbase{} is not well defined due to $\cexponent{} > 43$ as above.

\item
  Provide a separate instruction for clearing the \emph{global} bit on a
  capability.  \cappermG is currently treated as a permission, but it is
  really an information flow label rather than a permission. We may want to
  allow clearing the \cappermG bit on a sealed capability, which would
  be easiest to implement with a separate instruction, as permissions cannot
  be changed on sealed capabilities.

\item
  Provide multiple orthogonal capability ``colors'', expanding the
  local-global features to allow multiple consumers.
  We have considered in particular the use of colors to: (1) prevent kernel
  pointers from errantly wandering into userspace memory; (2) prevent user
  pointers from improperly moving between processes sharing some or all of
  their virtual address spaces; (3) prevent pointers from improperly flowing
  between intra-process protection domains; and (4) to prevent stack pointers
  from being improperly shared between threads.
  Section~\ref{sec:compactcolors} elaborates a more efficient representation
  for this coloring model, requiring one rather than two bits per color, by
  virtue of utilizing a new capability type to authorize color management.

\item
  Allow clearing of software-defined permission bits for sealed
  capabilities rather than requiring a domain switch or call to a privileged
  supervisor to do this.
  One way to do this would be to provide a separate instruction for clearing
  the software-defined permission bits
  on a sealed capability. The other permission bits on a sealed capability
  can be regarded as the permissions to access memory that the called protected
  subsystem will gain when \insnref{CInvoke} is invoked on the sealed
  capability; these should not be modifiable by the caller. On the other hand,
  the software-defined capability bits can be regarded as application-specific
  permissions that the caller has for the object that the sealed capability
  represents, and the caller might want to restrict these permissions before
  passing the sealed capability to another subsystem.

\item
  Provide a \insnnoref{CFromInt} instruction that copies a
  general-purpose integer register into the \coffset{} field of a capability register,
clearing all the other fields of the capability -- including the \ctag{} bit.
  This is an architecturally cleaner way to implement casting an
  \emph{int} to an \emph{intcap\_t} than the current approach of
  \insnref{CFromPtr} of the NULL pointer followed by
  \insnref{CSetOffset}.
\jhbnote{Is this still relevant if we assume merged register files?
  For merged register files, just storing to the non-capability
  register does this.}

\item
  Provide a variant of \insnref{CSetBounds} that sets imprecise bounds
  suitable for sealing with \insnref{CSeal}. In the 128-bit
  representation, the bounds of sealed capabilities have stronger alignment
  requirements than for unsealed capabilities.

\item Introduce a \insnref{CTestSubset} instruction, which would allow
  efficient testing of whether one capability describes rights that are a
  subset of another, directly exposing the partial order implied by subset
  tests in \insnref{CToPtr}, the proposed \insnref{CBuildCap}, etc.
  This is described in more detail in \cref{\insnlabelname{ctestsubset}}.
\jhbnote{RISC-V has this, so maybe this is no longer a TODO?}
  
\item
  Add versions of \insnref{CSetOffset} and \insnref{CIncOffset}
  that raise an exception, rather than clearing the tag bit, when the result
  is not representable. This would assist in debugging, by causing an
  exception to be raised at the point in the program when the capability
  became unrepresentable, rather than later on when the capability is
  dereferenced.

  An alternative implementation (rather than having separate trapping and
  non-trapping instructions) would be to add a status register that enables
  the trapping behavior. This is similar to floating point, where the
  FCSR controls whether a floating point overflow results in an IEEE
  infinity value or an exception being thrown.

  A cheap tag assertion instruction that can trigger a trap when a tag is lost
  would allow special compilation modes to improve debuggability by detecting
  unexpected tag loss sooner.

  If MIPS had a user status register, a tag-loss bit could be set implicitly
  on tag clear, allowing intermittent conditional-branch instructions to detect
  and handle loss.
 \jhbnote{This all seems OBE by moving to tag-clearing semantics}

\item
  Add a version of \insnref{CUnseal} that returns NULL, rather than
  raising an exception, if the security checks fail. A common use case
  for \insnref{CUnseal} is that a protected subsystem is passed a sealed
  capability by an untrusted (possibly malicious) caller, and the callee uses
  \insnref{CUnseal} to unseal it. It would be quicker for the callee
  to use a non-trapping \insnref{CUnseal} and then check that the result
  is not NULL, rather than either (a) catching the exception in the case that
  the untrusted caller has passed a bad capability; or (b) checking that
  the capability is suitable for unsealing before attempting to unseal it.

%\item
%  Add a \insnnoref{CGetPCCIncOffset} instruction that is similar to
%  \insnref{CGetPCCSetOffset}, except that it increments the offset
%  instead of setting it. This instruction could be useful (for example) when
%  using \insnref{CInvoke}; \insnnoref{CGetPCCIncOffset} would provide
%  a convenient way to construct a capability for the return address.
%  \arnote{This is included in ISAv8}

\item
  Add instructions for copying non-capability data from a capability register
  into a general-purpose integer register. A use case is when a function is called
  with a parameter whose type is the union of a pointer and a non-pointer type,
  such as an int. This parameter must be passed in a capability register, because
  the tag needs to be preserved when it holds a capability. If the body of
  the function accesses the non-capability branch of the union, it needs to
  get the non-capability bits out of the capability register and into a general
  purpose register. This can be done by spilling the capability register to the
  stack and then reading it back into a general-purpose integer register, but a register
  to register copy would be faster. (We need to investigate whether this happens
  often enough for the optimization to be worthwhile).

  With compressed 128-bit capabilities, two instructions are needed (to get
  the upper and lower 64 bits of the capability register).

\item
  Add an instruction that is like \insnref{CSetBounds} except that it
  sets \cbase{} to the current \cbase{} $+$ \coffset{} and the new length
  is the old \clength{} $-$ \coffset{} (i.e., the upper bound is unchanged).
  A question that needs to be resolved: what if the requested bounds cannot
  be represented exactly? The use case for this instruction is when its
  desired to move up the \cbase{} of the capability, without needing to
  extra instructions to explicitly calculate the new \clength{}.

\item
  Add an instruction that returns the alignment requirement for memory regions
  of a particular size. Having an instruction for this would avoid the
  need for memory allocators to know the details of the compression scheme.
\jhbnote{This is CRAM?}

\item Swapping and virtual-machine migration require that tags be stripped
  from capabilities as memory is serialized, and that tags be reattached to
  capabilities as memory is restored.
  Section~\ref{section:capability-reconstruction} describes a set of
  experimental instructions that improve the efficiency of these operations,
  but also avoid the need for software to directly inspect and interact with
  the in-memory representation of capabilities.
\end{itemize}

The following changes have been discussed for longer-term consideration:

\begin{itemize}
%\item Investigate a three-capability variation on object capabilities for the
%  128-bit version of CHERI.
%  This would provide more bits to be used in describing classes and objects,
%  and avoid requiring storing the object type in pointer bits.

\item Introduce finer-grained permissions (or new capability types) to express
  CPU privileges in a more granular way.
  For example, to allow management of interrupt-related CPU features without
  authorizing manipulation of the MMU.

\item Introduce a control-flow-focused ``immutable'' (or, more accurately,
  ``non-manipulable'') permission bit, which would prevent explicit changes to
  the bounds or offset, while still allowing the offset to be implicitly
  changed if the capability is placed in execution (i.e., is installed in
  \PCC{}.
  This would limit the ability of attackers, in the presence of a memory
  re-use bug, to manipulate the offset of a control-flow capability in order
  to attempt a code re-use exploit.
  Some care would be required -- e.g., to ensure that it was easy and
  efficient to update the value in the offset during OS exception handling,
  where it is common to adjust the value of the \PC{} forward after emulating
  an instruction.

\item Introduce further hardware permissions, such as physical-address load
  and store permissions, which would allow non-virtual-address interpretations
  of capabilities, bypassing the MMU.
  These might be appropriate for use by kernels, accelerators, and DMA engines
  there physical addresses (or perhaps hypervisor-virtualised physical
  addresses) offer great efficiency or improved semantics.

\item Consider whether any further instructions require variants that accept
  immediate values rather than register operands.
  Some already exist (e.g., when setting bounds or offsets, to avoid setting
  up integer register operands) but it may also be worth adding others.
  For example, if it transpires that permission-masking is a common operation
  in some workloads, a new \insnnoref{CAndPermImm} could be added.

\item Capability linearity, in which the architecture prevents duplication of
  a capability, might offer stronger invariants around protection-domain
  crossing.
  Section~\ref{section:linear-capabilities} describes an experimental proposal
  for how this might be implemented.

\item Today, a uniform set of capability roots are provided: \PCC{}, \DDC{},
  and possibly other special capability registers, are all
  preinitialised to grant all permissions across the full address space.
  This is a simple model that is easy to understand, but implies that certain
  efficiencies cannot be realized in the in-memory capability representation --
  for example, although sealing, CIDs, and memory access refer to different
  namespaces, we cannot efficiently encode
the
  lack of overlap to reduce the number of bits in capability representation.
%%%???

  Moving to multiple independent roots originating in different special
  registers would allow these efficiencies to be realized.
  For example, by having three different capability roots -- memory
  capabilities (with only virtual-address permissions), sealing capabilities
  (with only sealing and unsealing permissions), and compartment capabilities
  (with only CID permissions).

  A further root could be achieved by introducing a distinction between \PCC{}
  authorizing use of the privileged ISA (e.g., MMU configuration) and a special
  register used for this purpose.
  If a new ``system authorization special register'' were to be added, then a
  further System\_Access\_Registers-only root could be introduced, and derived
  capabilities could be installed into the special register when those
  privileges are required; a NULL capability could be installed when not in
  order to prevent use.

\item Introduce capability-extended versions of virtually indexed
  cache-management instructions.
  This is important in order to allow compartmentalized DMA-enabled device
  drivers to force write-back.
  Support for invalidate, however, remains challenging, as invalidate
  instructions could cause memory to ``rewind'', for example rolling back
  memory zeroing.
  This may require some changes around device drivers to avoid the need for
  direct use of invalidation instructions by unprivileged device drivers, and
  is a topic for further research.
\end{itemize}
