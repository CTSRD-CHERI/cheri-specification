\subsubsection*{Description}

Derives a new capability from the destination operand whose
\textbf{address} field is set to the bitwise inclusive OR of the
source operand and the \textbf{address} field of the destination
operand and then stores the result in the destination operand. The
destination operand can be a register or a memory location. The source
operand can be an immediate, a register, or a memory location.

If the new value of the \textbf{address} field makes the resulting
capability unrepresentable, the \textbf{tag} field in the resulting
capability is cleared.

\subsubsection*{Flags Affected}

The OF, SF, ZF, AF, CF, and PF flags are set according to the value of
the resulting \textbf{address} field.
