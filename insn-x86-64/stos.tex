\subsubsection*{Description}

Stores capability in the \CAX{} register into the destination operand.
The destination operand is a memory location identified by the \RDI{}
or \CDI{} register (depending on the addressing mode).  After the
capability is stored to memory, the address register is incremented or
decremented by the size of a capability according to the setting of
\texttt{DF} in \RFLAGS{}.

\subsubsection*{Flags Affected}

None
