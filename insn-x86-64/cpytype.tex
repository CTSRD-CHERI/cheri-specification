  \xopcode{VEX.LZ.66.0F.W0 0E \emph{/r}}{CPYTYPE \emph{rca, r/mc, rcb}}

    store in \emph{rca}.}

\end{x86opentable}

\subsubsection*{Description}

Constructs a new capability equal to the second operand with the
\textbf{address} field set to the \textbf{otype} field of the third
operand and stores the result in the first (destination) operand.
If the third operand's \textbf{otype} field is reserved or if the
second operand was sealed, the \textbf{tag} in the resulting
capability is cleared.

\subsubsection*{Flags Affected}

ZF is set to the \textbf{tag} field of the resulting capability.  The
CF, PF, AF, and OF flags are undefined.
