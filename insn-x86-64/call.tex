\subsubsection*{Description}

Saves return address on the stack and branches to the location
specified by the first operand.  In 64-bit mode the \insnnoref{CAP}
prefix can be used with opcode \texttt{FF /2} to select the capability
operand size instead of 64-bit.  In capability mode, near calls always
use the capability operand size.

Relative calls always apply the relative displacement to the address
of the next instruction to compute a new value of the \textbf{address}
field of \CIP{}.

Near calls which use a capability operand size always push \CIP{} onto
the current stack before executing the first instruction at the target
rather than pushing the value of \RIP{}.
