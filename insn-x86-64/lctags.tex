\begin{x86opcodetable}
  \xopcode{2F \emph{/r}}{LCTAGS \emph{r64, m8}}
  {RM}{Valid}{Valid}
  {Load bitmask of capability tags of \emph{m8} into \emph{r64}.}
\end{x86opcodetable}

\begin{x86opentable}
  \xopen{RM}{ModRM:Reg (w)}{ModRM:r/m (r)}{NA}{NA}
\end{x86opentable}

\subsubsection*{Description}

Loads a packed bitmask of capability tags for a stride of capabilities
in memory starting at the source operand and stores the bitmask in the
destination operand.  Bit 0 corresponds to tag for the capability at
the address of the source operand.  The authorizing capability for the
source operand must include \cappermL{} and \cappermLC{} and authorize
access to the entire stride of capabilities.  The source operand
address must also be aligned to a stride of capabilities.

If this instruction fails, it raises either a Capability Violation
Fault (see Section~\ref{sec:x86:capability-fault}) or a Page Fault.

\subsubsection*{Flags Affected}

ZF is set to 1 if the result is zero.  The CF, PF, AF, SF, and OF
flags are undefined.
