\subsubsection*{Description}

Loads a capablity from the source operand into the \CAX{} register.
The source operand is a memory location identified by the \RSI{} or
\CSI{} register (depending on the addressing mode).  After the
capability is loaded from memory, the address register is incremented
or decremented by the size of a capability according to the setting of
\texttt{DF} in \RFLAGS{}.

\subsubsection*{Flags Affected}

None
