\subsubsection*{Description}

Moves a capablity from the source operand to the destination operand.
The source operand is a memory location identified by the \RSI{} or
\CSI{} register (depending on the addressing mode).  The destination
operand is a memory location identified by the \RDI{} or \CDI{}
register (depending on the addressing mode).  After the capability is
copied, the address registers are incremented or decremented by the
size of a capability according to the setting of \texttt{DF} in
\RFLAGS{}.

\subsubsection*{Flags Affected}

None
