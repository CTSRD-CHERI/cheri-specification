\label{app:versions}

This appendix contains both a high-level summary of prior CHERI ISA versions
(Section~\ref{sec:detailed-cheri-isa-version-change-history}),
and also a detailed change log for each version
(Section~\ref{sec:detailed-cheri-isa-version-change-history}).
This report was previously made available as the {\em CHERI Architecture
Document}, but is now the {\em CHERI Instruction-Set Architecture}.

\section{CHERI ISA Specification Version Summary}
\label{sec:cheri-isa-specification-version-summary}

A short summary of key ISA versions is presented here:

\begin{description}
\item[CHERI ISAv1 - 1.0--1.4 - 2010--2012]
  Early versions of the CHERI ISA explored the integration of capability
  registers and tagged memory -- first in isolation from, and later in
  composition with, MMU-based virtual memory.
  CHERI-MIPS instructions were targeted only by an extended assembler, with an
  initial microkernel (``Deimos'') able to create compartments on bare metal,
  isolating small programs from one another.
  Key early design choices included:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item to compose with the virtual-memory mechanism by being an
    in-address-space protection feature, supporting complete MMU-based OSes,
  \item to use capabilities to implement code and data pointers for C-language
    TCBs, providing reference-oriented, fine-grained memory protection and
    control-flow integrity,
  \item to impose capability-oriented monotonic non-increase on pointers to
    prevent privilege escalation,
  \item to target capabilities with the compiler using explicit capability
    instructions (including load, store, and jumping/branching),
  \item to derive bounds on capabilities from existing code and data-structure
    properties, OS policy, and the heap and stack allocators,
  \item to have both in-register and in-memory capability storage,
  \item to use a separate capability register file (to be consistent with the
    MIPS coprocessor extension model),
  \item to employ tagged memory to preserve capability integrity and
    provenance outside of capability registers,
  \item to enforce monotonicity through constrained manipulation instructions,
  \item to provide software-defined (sealed) capabilities including a
    ``sealed'' bit, user-defined permissions, and object types,
  \item to support legacy integer pointers via a Default Data Capability
    (\DDC{}),
  \item to extend the program counter (\PC{}) to be the Program-Counter
    Capability (\PCC{}),
  \item to support not just fine-grained memory protection, but also
    higher-level protection models such as software compartmentalization or
    language-based encapsulation.
  \end{itemize}

\item[CHERI ISAv2 - 1.5 - August 2012]
  This version of the CHERI ISA developed a number of aspects of capabilities
  to better support C-language semantics, such as introducing tags on
  capability registers to support capability-oblivious memory copying, as well
  as improvements to support MMU-based operating systems.

\item[UCAM-CL-TR-850 - 1.9 - June 2014]
  This technical report accompanied publication of our ISCA 2014 paper on
  CHERI memory protection.
  Changes from CHERI ISAv2 were significant, supporting a complete
  conventional OS (CheriBSD) and compiler suite (CHERI Clang/LLVM), a defined
  \insnnoref{CCall}/\insnnoref{CReturn} mechanism
  for software-defined
  object capabilities, capability-based load-linked/store-conditional
  instructions to support multi-threaded software, exception-handling
  improvements such as a CP2 cause register, new instructions
  \insnref{CToPtr} and \insnref{CFromPtr} to improve compiler
  efficiency for hybrid compilation, and changes relating to object
  capabilities, such as user-defined permission bits and instructions to check
  permissions/types.

\item[CHERI ISAv3 - 1.10 - September 2014]
  CHERI ISAv3 further converges C-language pointers and capabilities, improves
  exception-handling behavior, and continues to mature support for
  object capabilities.
  A key change is shifting from C-language pointers being represented by the
  base of a capability to having an independent ``offset'' (implemented as a
  ``cursor'') so that monotonicity is imposed only on bounds, and not on the
  pointer itself.
  Pointers are allowed to move outside of their defined bounds, but can be
  dereferenced only within them.
  There is also a new instruction for C-language pointer comparison
  (\insnnoref{CPtrCmp}), and a NULL capability has been defined
  as having
  an in-memory representation of all zeroes without a tag, ensuring that BSS
  (pre-zeroed memory) operates without change.
  The offset behavior is also propagated into code capabilities, changing the
  behavior of \PCC{}, \EPCC{}, \insnref{CJR}, \insnref{CJALR}, and
  several aspects of exception handling.
  The sealed bit was moved out of the permission mask to be a stand-alone bit
  in the capability, and we went from independent \insnnoref{CSealCode}
  and \insnnoref{CSealData} instructions to a single \insnref{CSeal}
  instruction, and the \insnnoref{CSetType} instruction has been removed.
  While the object type originates as a virtual address in an authorizing
  capability, that interpretation is not mandatory due to use of a separate
  hardware-defined permission for sealing.

\item[UCAM-CL-TR-864 - 1.11 - January 2015]
  This technical report refines CHERI ISAv3's convergence of C-language
  pointers and capabilities; for example, it adds a \insnref{CIncOffset}
  instruction that avoids read-modify-write accesses to adjust the offset
  field, as well as exception-handling improvements.
  TLB permission bits relating to capabilities now have modified semantics:
  if the load-capability bit is not present, than capability tags are stripped
  on capability loads from a page, whereas capability stores trigger an
  exception, reflecting the practical semantics found most useful in our
  CheriBSD prototype.

\item[CHERI ISAv4 / UCAM-CL-TR-876 - 1.15 - November 2015]
  This technical report describes \\
  CHERI ISAv4, introducing concepts required
  to support 128-bit compressed capabilities.
  A new \insnref{CSetBounds} instruction is added, allowing adjustments
  to both lower and upper bounds to be simultaneously exposed to the hardware,
  providing more information when making compression choices.
  Various instruction definitions were updated for the potential for
  imprecision in bounds.
  New chapters were added on the protection model, and how CHERI features
  compose to provide stronger overall protection for secure software.
  Fast register-clearing instructions are added to accelerate domain switches.
  A full set of capability-based load-linked, store-conditional instructions
  are added, to better support multi-threaded pure-capability programs.

\item[CHERI ISAv5 / UCAM-CL-TR-891 - 1.18 - June 2016]
  CHERI ISAv5 primarily serves to introduce the CHERI-128 compressed
  capability model, which supersedes prior candidate models.
  A new instruction, \insnnoref{CGetPCCSetOffset}, allows jump targets to
  be more efficiently calculated relative to the current \PCC{}.
  The previous multiple privileged capability permissions authorizing access
  to exception-handling state has been reduced down to a single system
  privilege to reduce bit consumption in capabilities, but also to recognize
  their effective non-independence.
  In order to reduce code-generation overhead, immediates to
  capability-relative loads and stores are now scaled.

\item[CHERI ISAv6 / UCAM-CL-TR-907 - 1.20 - April 2017]
  CHERI ISAv6 introduces support for kernel-mode compartmentalization,
  jump-based rather than exception-based domain transition,
  architecture-abstracted and efficient tag restoration, and more efficient
  generated code.
  A new chapter addresses potential applications of the CHERI protection model
  to the RISC-V and x86-64 ISAs, previously described relative only to the
  64-bit MIPS ISA.
  CHERI ISAv6 better explains our design rationale and research methodology.

\item[CHERI ISAv7 / UCAM-CL-TR-927 - 7.0 - June 2019]
  We more clearly differentiate an archi\-tecture-neutral CHERI protection
  model vs. architecture-specific instantiations in 64-bit MIPS, 64-bit
  RISC-V, and x86-64.
  We have defined a new capability compression scheme, CHERI Concentrate, and
  deprecated the previous CHERI-128 scheme.
  CHERI-MIPS now supports special-purpose capability registers, which have
  been moved out of the numbered general-purpose capability register space.
  New special-purpose capability registers, including those for thread-local
  storage, have been defined.
  CHERI-RISC-V is more substantially elaborated.
  A new compartment-ID register assists in resisting microarchitectural
  side-channel attacks.
  New optimized instructions with immediate fields improve the performance of
  generated code.
  Experimental 64-bit capabilities have been defined for 32-bit architectures,
  as well as instructions to accelerate spatial and temporal memory safety.
  The opcode reencoding begun in prior CHERI ISA specification versions has
  now been completed.

\item[CHERI ISAv8 / UCAM-CL-TR-951 - 8.0 - October 2020]
  Capability compression is now part of the abstract model.
  Both 32-bit and 64-bit architectural address sizes are supported.
  Various previously experimental features, such as sentry capabilities and
  CHERI-RISC-V, are now considered mature. We have defined a number of new
  temporal memory-safety acceleration features including MMU assistance for a
  load-side-barrier revocation model.
  We have added a chapter on practical CHERI microarchitecture.
  CHERI ISAv8 is synchronized with Arm Morello.

\section{Detailed CHERI ISA Version Change History}
\label{sec:detailed-cheri-isa-version-change-history}

\begin{description}
\item[1.0] This first version of the CHERI architecture document was prepared
  for a six-month deliverable to DARPA.
  It included a high-level architectural description of CHERI, motivations
  for our design choices, and an early version of the capability instruction
  set.

\item[1.1] The second version was prepared in preparation for a meeting of the
  CTSRD External Oversight Group (EOG) in Cambridge during May 2011.
  The update followed a week-long meeting in Cambridge, UK, in which many
  aspects of the CHERI architecture were formalized, including
  details of the capability instruction set.

\item[1.2] The third version of the architecture document came as the first
  annual reports from the CTSRD project were in preparation, including a
  decision to break out formal-methods appendices into their own {\em CHERI
  Formal Methods Report} for the first time.
  With an in-progress prototype of the CHERI capability unit, we
  significantly refined the CHERI ISA with respect to object capabilities, and
  matured notions such as a trusted stack and the role of an
  operating system supervisor.
  The formal methods portions of the document was dramatically
  expanded, with proofs of correctness for many basic security properties.
  Satisfyingly, many `future work' items in earlier versions of the report
  were becoming completed work in this version!

\item[1.3] The fourth version of the architecture document was released 
  while 
  the first functional CHERI prototype was in testing.  It reflects on
  initial experiences adapting a microkernel to exploit CHERI capability
  features.
  This led to minor architectural refinements, such as improvements to
  instruction opcode layout, some additional instructions (such as allowing
  \insnref{CGetPerm} retrieve the unsealed bit), and automated
  generation of opcode descriptions based on our work in creating a
  CHERI-enhanced MIPS assembler.

\item[1.4] This version updated and clarified a number of aspects of CHERI
  following a prototype implementation used to demonstrate CHERI in November
  2011.
  Changes include updates to the CHERI architecture diagram; replacement of
  the \insnnoref{CDecLen} instruction with \insnnoref{CSetLen},
  addition of a \insnref{CMove} instruction;
  improved descriptions of exception generation; clarification of the
  in-memory representation of capabilities and byte order of permissions;
  modified instruction encodings for \insnref{CGetLen},
  \insnref{CMove}, and \insnnoref{CSetLen};
  specification of reset state for capability registers; and clarification of
  the \insnnoref{CIncBase} instruction.

\item[1.5] This version of the document was produced almost two years
  into the CTSRD project.  It documented a significant revision (version 2) to
  the CHERI ISA, which was motivated by our efforts to introduce
  C-language extensions and compiler support for CHERI, with
  improvements resulting from operating system-level work and
  restructuring the BSV hardware specification to be more
  amenable to formal analysis.  The ISA, programming language, and
  operating system sections were significantly updated.

\item[1.6] This version made incremental refinements to version 2 of the
  CHERI ISA, and also introduced early discussion of the CHERI2 prototype.

\item[1.7] Roughly two and a half years into the project, this version
  clarified and extended documentation of CHERI ISA features such as
  \insnnoref{CCall}/\insnnoref{CReturn} and its software emulation,
  Permit\_Set\_Type, the \insnref{CMove}
  pseudo-op, new load-linked and instructions for store-conditional relative
  to capabilities, and several bug fixes such as corrections to sign extension
  for several instructions.
  A new capability-coprocessor {\pathname cause} register, retrieved using a new
  \insnnoref{CGetCause}, was added to allow querying information on the
  most recent
  CP2 exception (e.g., bounds-check vs type-check violations); priorities were
  provided, and also clarified with respect to coprocessor exceptions vs.
  other MIPS ISA exceptions (e.g., unaligned access).
  This was the first version of the {\em CHERI Architecture Document} released
  to early adopters.

\item[1.8] Less than three and a half years into the project, this version
  refined the CHERI ISA based on experience with compiler, OS, and userspace
  development using the CHERI model.
  To improve C-language compatibility, new instructions \insnref{CToPtr}
  and \insnref{CFromPtr} were defined.
  The capability permissions mask was extended to add user-defined permissions.
  Clarifications were made to the behavior of jump/branch instructions relating
  to branch-delay slots and the program counter.
  \insnref{CClearTag} simply cleared a register's tag, not its value.
  A software-defined capability-cause register range was made available, with a
  new \insnnoref{CSetCause} instruction letting software set the cause for
  testing or control-flow reasons.
  New \insnnoref{CCheckPerm} and \insnnoref{CCheckType} instructions
  were added, letting software
  object methods explicitly test for permissions and the types of arguments.
  TLB permission bits were added to authorize use of loading and storing
  tagged values from pages.
  New \insnnoref{CGetDefault} and \insnnoref{CSetDefault} pseudo-ops
  have become the preferred way to control MIPS ISA memory access.
  \insnnoref{CCall}/\insnnoref{CReturn} calling conventions were
  clarified; \insnnoref{CCall} now pushes the
  incremented version of the program counter, as well as stack pointer, to the
  trusted stack.

\item[1.9 - UCAM-CL-TR-850]
  The document was renamed from the {\em CHERI Architecture Document} to the
  {\em CHERI Instruction-Set Architecture}.
  This version of the document was made available as a University of Cambridge
  Technical Report.
  The high-level ISA description and ISA reference were broken out into
  separate chapters.
  A new rationale chapter was added, along with more detailed explanations
  throughout about design choices.
  Notes were added in a number of places regarding non-MIPS adaptations of
  CHERI and 128-bit variants.
  Potential future directions, such as capability cursors, are discussed in
  more detail.
  Further descriptions of the memory-protection model and its use by operating
  systems and compilers was added.
  Throughout, content has been updated to reflect more recent work on compiler
  and operating-system support for CHERI.
  Bugs have been fixed in the specification of the \insnref{CJR} and
  \insnref{CJALR} instructions.
  Definitions and behavior for user-defined permission bits and OS exception
  handling have been clarified.

\item[1.10]
  This version of the Instruction-Set Architecture is timed for delivery at
  the end of the fourth year of the CTSRD Project.  It reflects a significant
  further revision to the ISA (version 3) focused on C-language compatibility,
  better exception-handling semantics, and reworking of the object-capability
  mechanism.

  The definition of the NULL capability has been revised such that the memory
  representation is now all zeroes, and with a zeroed tag.  This allows
  zeroed memory (e.g., ELF BSS segments) to be interpreted as being filled
  with NULL capabilities.  To this end, the tag is now defined as unset, and
  the Unsealed bit has now been inverted to be a Sealed bit; the
  \insnnoref{CGetUnsealed} instruction has been renamed to
  \insnnoref{CGetSealed}.

  A new \coffset{} field has been added to the capability, which converts CHERI
  from a simple base/length capability to blending capabilities and fat
  pointers that associate a base and bounds with an offset.
  This approach learns from the extensive fat-pointer research literature to
  improve C-language compatibility.
  The offset can take on any 64-bit value, and is added to the base on
  dereference; if the resulting pointer does not fall within the base and
  length, then an exception will be thrown.
  New instructions are added to read (\insnref{CGetOffset}) and write
  (\insnref{CSetOffset}) the
  field, and the semantics of memory access and other CHERI instructions
  (e.g., \insnnoref{CIncBase}) are updated for this new behavior.

  A new \insnnoref{CPtrCmp} instruction has been added, which provides
  C-friendly
  comparison of capabilities; the instruction encoding supports various types
  of comparisons including `equal to', `not equal to', and both signed and
  unsigned `less than' and `less than or equal to' operators.

  \insnnoref{CGetPCC} now returns \PC{} as the \coffset{} field of the
  returned \PCC{} rather than storing it to a general-purpose integer register.
  \insnref{CJR} and \insnref{CJALR} now accept target \PC{} values
  via the offsets of their
  jump-target capability arguments rather than via explicit general-purpose
  integer registers.
  \insnref{CJALR} now allows specification of the return-program-counter
  capability register in a manner similar to return-address arguments to the
  MIPS \insnnoref{JALR} instruction.

  \insnnoref{CCall} and \insnnoref{CReturn} are updated to save and
  restore the saved \PC{} in the
  \coffset{} field of the saved \EPCC{} rather than separately.
  \EPCC{} now incorporates the saved exception \PC{} in its \coffset{} field.
  The behavior of \EPCC{} and expectations about software-supervisor behavior
  are described in greater detail.
  The security implications of exception cause-code precedence as relates to
  alignment and the emulation of unaligned loads and stores are clarified.
  The behavior of \insnnoref{CSetCause} has been clarified to indicate
  that the instruction should not raise an exception unless the check for
  \capperm*{Access\_EPCC} fails.
  When an exception is raised due to the state of an argument register for
  an instruction, it is now defined which register will be named as the source
  of the exception in the capability cause register.

  The object-capability type field is now 24-bit; while a relationship to
  addresses is maintained in order to allow delegation of type allocation,
  that relationship is deemphasized.
  It is assumed that the software type manager will impose any required
  semantics on the field, including any necessary uniqueness for the software
  security model.
  The \insnnoref{CSetType} instruction has been removed, and a single
  \insnnoref{CSeal} instruction
  replaces the previous separate \insnnoref{CSealCode} and
  \insnnoref{CSealData} instructions.

  The validity of capability fields accessed via the ISA is now defined for
  untagged capabilities; the undefinedness of the in-memory representation of
  capabilities is now explicit in order to permit `non-portable'
  micro-architectural optimizations.

  There is now a structured description of the pseudocode language used in
  defining instructions.
  Format numbers have now been removed from instruction descriptions.

  Ephemeral capabilities are renamed to `local capabilities,' and
  non-ephemeral capabilities are renamed to `global capabilities'; the
  semantics are unchanged.

\item[1.11 - UCAM-CL-TR-864]
  This version of the CHERI ISA has been prepared for publication as a
  University of Cambridge technical report.
  It includes a number of refinements to CHERI ISA version 3 based on further
  practical implementation experience with both C-language memory protection
  and software compartmentalization.

  There are a number of updates to the specification reflecting introduction
  of the \coffset{} field, including discussion of its semantics.
  A new \insnref{CIncOffset} instruction has been added, which avoids the
  need to read the offset into a general-purpose integer register for frequent
  arithmetic operations on pointers.
   
  Interactions between \EPC{} and \EPCC{} are now better specified, including
    that use of untagged capabilities has undefined behavior.
  \insnnoref{CBTS} and \insnnoref{CBTU} are now defined to use
    branch-delay slots, matching other MIPS-ISA branch instructions.
  \insnref{CJALR} is defined as suitably incrementing the returned
    program counter, along with branch-delay slot semantics.
  Additional software-path pseudocode is present for \insnnoref{CCall} and
    \insnnoref{CReturn}.

  \insnref{CAndPerm} and \insnref{CGetPerm} use of argument-register
    or return-register permission bits has been clarified.
  Exception priorities and cause-code register values have been defined,
    clarified, or corrected for \insnref{CClearTag},
  \insnnoref{CGetPCC}, \insnref{CSC}, and \insnref{CSeal}.
  Sign or zero extension for immediates and offsets are now defined
    \insnnoref[clbhwd]{CL}, \insnnoref[clbhwd]{CS},
    and other instructions.

  Exceptions caused due to TLB bits controlling loading and storing of
    capabilities are now CP2 rather than TLB exceptions, reducing code-path
    changes for MIPS exception handlers.
  These TLB bits now have modified semantics: {\bf LC} now discards tag bits
    on the underlying line rather than throwing an exception; {\bf SC} will
    throw an exception only if a tagged store would result, rather than
    whenever a write occurs from a capability register.
  These affect \insnref{CLC} and \insnref{CSC}.

  Pseudocode definitions now appear earlier in the chapter, and have now been
    extended to describe \EPCC{} behavior.
  The ISA reference has been sorted alphabetically by instruction name.

\item[1.12] This is an interim release as we begin to grapple with 128-bit
  capabilities.
  This requires us to better document architectural assumptions, but also
  start to propose changes to the instruction set to reflect differing
  semantics (e.g., exposing more information to potential capability
  compression).
  A new \insnref{CSetBounds} instruction is proposed, which allows both
  the base and length of a capability to be set in a single instruction, which
  may allow the micro-architecture to reduce potential loss of precision.
  Pseudocode is now provided for both the pure-exception version of the
  \insnnoref{CCall} instruction, and also hardware-accelerated permission
  checking.

\item[1.13] This is an interim release as our 128-bit capability format (and
  general awareness of imprecision) evolves; this release also makes early
  infrastructural changes to support an optional converging of capability and
  general-purpose integer register files.

  Named constants, rather than specific sizes (e.g., 256-bit vs. 128-bit) are
  now used throughout the specification.
  Reset state for permissions is now relative to available permissions.
  Two variations on 128-bit capabilities are defined, employing two variations
  on capability compression.
  Throughout the specification, the notion of ``representable'' is now
  explicitly defined, and non-representable values must now be handled.

  The definitions of \insnref{CIncOffset}, \insnref{CSetOffset}, and
  \insnref{CSeal} have been modified to reflect the potential for
  imprecision.
  In the event of a loss of precision, the capability base, rather than
  offset, will be preserved, allowing the underlying memory object to continue
  to be accurately represented.

  Saturating behavior is now defined when a compressed capability's length
  could represent a value greater than the maximum value for a 64-bit MIPS
  integer register.

  EPCC behavior is now defined when a jump or branch target might push the
  offset of PCC outside of the representable range for EPCC.

  \insnnoref{CIncBase} and \insnnoref{CSetLen} are deprecated in favor
  of \insnref{CSetBounds}, which presents changes to base and bounds to
  the hardware atomically.
  The \insnref{CMove} pseudo-operation is now implemented using
  \insnref{CIncOffset} rather than \insnnoref{CIncBase}.
  \insnref{CFromPtr} has been modified to behave more like
  \insnref{CSetOffset}: only the offset, not the base, is modified.
  Bug fixes have been applied to the definitions of \insnref{CSetBounds}
  and \insnref{CUnseal}.

  Several bugs in the specification of \insnref{CLC}, \insnnoref{CLLD},
  \insnref{CSC}, and \insnnoref[csbhwd]{CSD}, relating to omissions
  during the update to capability offsets, have been fixed.
  \insnref{CLC}'s description has been updated to properly reflect its
  immediate argument.

  New instructions \insnnoref{CClearHi} and \insnnoref{CClearLo} have
  been added to accelerate register clearing during protection-domain
  switches.

  New pseudo-ops \insnnoref{CGetEPCC}, \insnnoref{CSetEPCC},
  \insnnoref{CGetKCC}, \insnnoref{CSetKCC}, \insnnoref{CGetKDC}, and
  \insnnoref{CSetKDC} have been defined, in the interests of better
  supporting a migration of `special' registers out of the capability register
  file -- which facilitates a convergence of capability and general-purpose
  integer register files.

\item[1.14]
  Two new chapters have been added, one describing the abstract CHERI
  protection model in greater detail (and independent from concrete ISA
  changes), and the second exploring the composition of CHERI's ISA-level
  features in supporting higher-level software protection models.

  The value of the NULL capability is now centrally defined (all fields zero;
  untagged).

  \insnnoref{ClearLo} and \insnnoref{ClearHi} instructions are now
  defined for clearing general-purpose integer registers, supplementing
  \insnnoref{CClearHi} and \insnnoref{CClearLo}.
  All four instructions are described together under \insnnoref{CClearRegs}.

  A new \insnref{CSetBoundsExact} instruction is defined, allowing an
  exception to be thrown if an attempt to narrow bounds cannot occur
  precisely.
  This is intended for use in memory allocators where it is a software
  invariant that bounds are always exact.
  A new exception code is defined for this case.

  A full range of data widths are now support for capability-relative
  load-linked, store conditional: \insnnoref{CLLB}, \insnnoref{CLLH},
  \insnnoref{CLLW}, \insnnoref{CLLD}, \insnnoref{CSCB},
  \insnnoref{CSCH}, \insnnoref{CSCW}, and \insnnoref{CSCD} (as well as
  unsigned load-linked variations).
  Previously, only a doubleword variation was defined, but cannot be used to
  emulate the narrower widths as fine-grained bounds around a narrow type
  would throw a bounds-check exception.
  Existing load-linked, store-conditional variations for capabilities
  (\insnref{CLLC}, \insnnoref{CSCC}) have been updated, including with
  respect to opcode assignments.

  A new `candidate three' variation on compressed capabilities has been
  defined, which differentiates sealed and unsealed formats.
  The unsealed variation invests greater numbers of bits in bounds accuracy,
  and has a full 64-bit cursor, but does not contain a broader set of
  software-defined permissions or an object-type field.
  The sealed variation also has a full 64-bit cursor, but has reduced bounds
  accuracy in return for a 20-bit object-type field and a set of
  software-defined permissions.

  `Candidate two' of compressed capabilities has been updated to reflect
  changes in the hardware prototype by reducing toBase and toBound precision
  by one bit each.

  Explicit equations have been added explaining how bounds are calculated
  from each of the 128-bit compressed capability candidates, as well as their
  alignment requirements.

  Exception priorities have been documented (or clarified) for a number of
  instructions including \insnref{CJALR}, \insnref{CLC},
  \insnnoref{CLLD}, \insnref{CSC}, \insnnoref{CSCC},
  \insnnoref{CSetLen}, \insnref{CSeal}, \insnref{CUnSeal}, and
  \insnref{CSetBounds}.

  The behavior of \insnnoref{CPtrCmp} is now defined when an undefined
  comparison type is used.

  It is clarified that capability store failures due to TLB-enforced
  limitations on capability stores trigger a TLB, rather than a CP2,
  exception.

  A new capability comparison instruction, \insnnoref{CEXEQ}, checks
  whether all fields in the capability are equal; the previous
  \insnnoref{CEQ} instruction checked only that their offsets pointed at the
  same location.

  A new capability instruction, \insnref{CSUB}, allows the implementation
  of C-language pointer subtraction semantics with the atomicity properties
  required for garbage collection.

  The list of BERI- and CHERI-related publications, including peer-reviewed
  conference publications and technical reports, has been updated.

\item[1.15 - UCAM-CL-TR-876]
  This version of the CHERI ISA, \textit{CHERI ISAv4}, has been prepared for
  publication as a University of Cambridge technical report.

  The instructions \insnnoref{CIncBase} and \insnnoref{CSetLen}
  (deprecated in version 1.13 of the CHERI ISA) have now been removed in favor
  of \insnref{CSetBounds} (added in version 1.12 of the CHERI ISA).
  The new instruction was introduced in order to atomically expose changes to
  both upper and lower bounds of a capability, rather than requiring them to
  be updated separately, required to implement compressed capabilities.

  The design rationale has been updated to better describe our ongoing
  exploration of whether special registers (such as \KCC{}) should be in the
  capability register file, and the potential implications of shifting to a
  userspace exception handler for \insnnoref{CCall}/\insnnoref{CReturn}.

\item[1.16] This is an interim update of the instruction-set specification in
  which aspects of the 128-bit capability model are clarified and extended.

  The ``candidate 3'' unsealed 128-bit compressed capability representation
  has been to increase the exponent field (\cexponent{}) to 6 bits from 4, and
  the \cbasebits{} and \ctopbits{} fields have been reduced to 20 bits each
  from the 22 bits.
  \cperms{} has been increased from 11 to 15 to allow for a larger set of
  software-defined permissions.
% XXX-BD: 2 - 4 + 4 != 0.  Presumably we consumed two reserved bits?
  The sealed representation has also been updated similarly, with a total of
  10 bits for \cotype{} (split over {\bf otypeLow} and {\bf otypeHigh}), 10
  bits each for \cbasebits{} and \ctopbits{}, and a 6-bit exponent.
  The algorithm for decompressing a compressed capability has been changed to
  better utilize the encoding space, and to more clearly differentiate
  representable from in-bounds values.
  A variety of improvements and clarifications have been made to the
  compression model and its description.

  Differences between, and representations of, permissions for 128-bit and
  256-bit capability are now better described.

  Capability unrepresentable exceptions will now be thrown in various
  situations where the result of a capability manipulation or operation cannot
  be represented.
  For manipulations such as \insnref{CSeal} and \insnref{CFromPtr},
  an exception will be thrown.
  For operations such as \insnnoref{CBTU} and \insnnoref{CBTS}, the
  exception will be thrown on the first instruction fetch following a branch
  to an unrepresentable target, rather than on the branch instruction itself.
  CHERI1 and CHERI2 no longer differ on how out-of-bounds exceptions are
  thrown for capability branches: it uniformly occurs on fetching the target
  instruction.

  The ISA specification makes it more clear that \insnnoref{CEQ},
  \insnnoref{CNE}, \insnnoref[cptrcmp]{CL[TE]U}, and \insnnoref{CEXEQ} are
  forms of the \insnnoref{CPtrCmp} instruction.

  The ISA todo list has been updated to recommend a capability
  conditional-move (\insnnoref{CCMove}) instruction.

  There is now more explicit discussion of the MIPS n64 ABI, Hybrid ABI,
  and Pure-Capability ABI.
  Conventions for capability-register have been updated and clarified --
  for example, register assignments for the stack capability, jump register,
  and link register.
  The definition that {\bf RCC}, the return code capability, is register
  \creg{24} has been updated to reflect our use of \creg{17} in actual code
  generation.

  Erroneous references to an undefined instruction \insnnoref{CSetBase},
  introduced during removal of the \insnnoref{CIncBase} instruction, have
  been corrected to refer to \insnref{CSetBounds}.

\item[1.17] This is an interim update of the instruction-set architecture
  enhancing (and specifying in more detail) the CHERI-128 ``compressed''
  128-bit capability format, better aligning the 128-bit and 256-bit models,
  and adding capability-related instructions required for more efficient code
  generation.
  This is a draft release of what will be considered \textit{CHERI ISAv5}.

  The chapter on ISA design now includes a section describing ``deep'' versus
  ``surface'' aspects of the CHERI model as mapped into the ISA.
  For example, use of tagged capabilities is a core aspect of the model, but
  the particular choice to have a separate capability register file, rather
  than extending general-purpose integer registers to optionally hold capabilities, is
  a surface design choice in that the operating system and compiler can target
  the same software-visible protection model against both.
  Likewise, although CHERI-128 specifies a concrete compression model, a range
  of compression approaches are accepted by the CHERI model.

  A new chapter has been added describing some of our assumptions about how
  capabilities will be used to build secure systems, for example, that
  untrusted code will not be permitted to modify TLB state -- which permits
  changing the interpretation of capabilities relative to virtual addresses.

  The rationale chapter has been updated to more thoroughly describe our
  capability compression design space.

  A new CHERI ISA quick-reference appendix has been added to the
  specification, documenting both current and proposed instruction
  encodings.

  Sections of the introduction on historical context have been shifted to a
  stand-alone chapter.

  Descriptions in the introduction have been updated relating to
  our hardware and software prototypes.

  References to PhD dissertations on CHERI have been added to the publications
  section of the introduction.

  A clarification has been added: the use of the term ``capability
  coprocessor'' relates to CHERI's utilization of the MIPS ISA coprocessor
  opcode space, and is not intended to suggest substantial decoupling of
  capability-related processing from the processor design.

  Compressed capability ``candidate 3'' is now CHERI-128. The \cbasebits{},
  \ctopbits{} and
  \ccursor{} fields have been renamed respectively \cB{}, \cT{} and \caddr{}
  (following the terminology used in the micro paper). When sealed, only the
  top 8 bits of the \cB{} and \cT{} fields are preserved, and the bottom 12
  bits are zeroes, which implies stronger alignment requirements for sealed
  capabilities. The exponent \cexponent{} field remains a 6-bit field, but its
  bottom 2 bits are ignored, as it is believed that coarser granularity is
  acceptable, and making the hardware simpler. The \cotype{} field benefits
  from the shorter \cB{} and \cT{} fields and is now 24 bits -- which is the same
  as the \cotype{} for 256-bit CHERI. Finally, the representable region
  associated with a capability has changed from being centred around the
  described object to an asymmetric region with more space above the object
  than below. The full description is available in Section~\ref{compression}.

  Alignment requirements for software allocators (such as stack and heap
  allocators) in the presence of capability compression are now more
  concisely described.

  The immediate operands to load and store instructions, including
  \insnnoref{CLC}, \insnnoref{CSC}, \insnnoref[clbhwd]{CL[BHWD][U]}, and
  \insnnoref[csbhwd]{CS[BHWD]} are now ``scaled'' by the width of the data being
  stored (with the exception of capability stores, where scaling is by 16
  bytes regardless of in-memory capability size).
  This extends the range of capability-relative loads and stores, permitting
  a far greater proportion of stack spills to be expressed without additional
  stack-pointer modification.
  This is a binary-incompatible change to the ISA.

  The textual description of the \insnref{CSeal} instruction has been
  updated to match the pseudocode in using $>=$ rather than $>$ in selecting
  an exception code.

  A redundant check has been removed in the definition of the
  \insnref{CUnseal} instruction, and an explanation added.

  Opcodes have now been specified for the \insnref{CSetBoundsExact} and
  \insnref{CSub} instructions.

  To improve code generation when constructing a \PCC{}-relative capability as
  a jump target, a new \insnnoref{CGetPCCSetOffset} instruction has been
  added.
  This instruction has the combined effects of performing sequential
  \insnnoref{CGetPCC} and \insnref{CSetOffset} operations.

  A broader set of opcode rationalizations and cleanups have been applied
  across the ISA, to facilitate efficient decoding and future use of the
  opcode space.
  This includes changes to \insnnoref{CGetPCC}.

  \creg{25} is no longer reserved for exception-handler use, as \creg{27} and
  \creg{28} are already reserved for this purpose.
  It is therefore available for ABI use.

  The 256-bit architectural capability model has been updated to use a single
  system permission, \cappermASR, to control access to
  exception-handling and privileged ISA state, rather than splitting it over
  multiple permissions.
  This brings the permission models in 128-bit and 256-bit representations
  back into full alignment from a software perspective.
  This also simplifies permission checking for instructions such as
  \insnnoref{CClearRegs}.
  The permission numbering space has been rationalized as part of this change.
  Similarly, the set of exceptions has been updated to reflect a single system
  permission.
  The descriptions of various instructions (such as \insnnoref{CClearRegs}
  have been updated with respect to revised protections for special registers
  and exception handling.

  The descriptions of \insnnoref{CCall} and \insnnoref{CReturn} now
  include an explanation of additional software-defined behavior such as
  capability control-flow based on the local/global model.

  The common definition of privileged registers (included in the definitions
  of instructions) has been updated to explicitly include \EPCC{}.

  Future ISA additions are proposed to add testing of branch instructions for
  NULL and non-NULL capabilities.

\item[1.18 - UCAM-CL-TR-891] This version of the CHERI ISA,
  \textit{CHERI ISAv5}, has been prepared for publication as a University of
  Cambridge technical report.

  The chapter on the CHERI protection model has been refined and extending,
  including adding more information on sealed capabilities, the link between
  memory allocation and the setting of bounds and permissions, more detailed
  coverage of capability flow control, and interactions with MMU-based models.

  A new chapter has been added exploring assumptions that must be made when
  building high-assurance software for CHERI.

  The detailed ISA version history has shifted from the introduction to a new
  appendix; a summary of key versions is maintained in the introduction, along
  with changes in the current document version.

  A glossary of key terms has been added.

  The term ``coprocessor'' is deemphasized, as, while it refers correctly to
  CHERI's use of the MIPS opcode extension space, some readers found it
  suggestive of an independent hardware unit rather than tight integration into
  the processor pipeline and memory subsystem.

  A reference has been added to Robert Norton's PhD dissertation on optimized
  CHERI domain switching.

  A reference has been added to our PLDI 2016 paper on C-language semantics and
  their interaction with the CHERI model.

  The object-type field in both 128-bit and 256-bit capabilities is now 24 bits,
  with Top and Bottom fields reduced to 8 bits for sealed capabilities.
  This reflects a survey of current object-oriented software systems, suggesting
  that 24 bits is a more reasonable upper bound than 20 bits.

  The assembly arguments to \insnref{CJALR} have been swapped for greater
  consistency with jump-and-link register instructions in the MIPS ISA.

  We have reduced the number of privileged permissions in the 256-bit capability
  model to a single privileged permission, \cappermASR, to match
  128-bit CHERI.
  This is a binary-incompatible change.

  We have improved the description of the CHERI-128 model in a number of ways,
  including a new section on the CHERI-128 representable bounds check.

  The architecture chapter contains a more detailed discussion of potential ways
  to reduce the overhead of CHERI by reducing the number of capability
  registers, converging the general-purpose integer and capability register files,
  capability compression, and so on.

  We have extended our discussion of ``deep'' vs ``shallow'' aspects of the
  CHERI model.

  New sections describe potential non-pointer uses of capabilities, as well as
  possible uses as primitives supporting higher-level languages.

  Instructions that convert from integers to capabilities now share common
  \ccode{int_to_cap} pseudocode.

  The notes on \insnnoref{CBTS} have been synchronized to those on
  \insnnoref{CBTU}.

  Use of language has generally been improved to differentiate the
  architectural 256-bit capability model (e.g., in which its fields are
  64-bit) from the 128-bit and 256-bit in-memory representations.
  This includes consideration of differing representations of capability
  permissions in the architectural interface (via instructions) and the
  microarchitectural implementation.

  A number of descriptions of features of, and motivations for, the CHERI design
  have been clarified, extended, or otherwise improved.

  It is clarified that when combining immediate and register operands with
  the base and offset, 64-bit wrap-around is permitted in capability-relative
  load and store instructions -- rather than throwing an exception.
  This is required to support sound optimizations in frequent
  compiler-generated load/store sequences for C-language programs.

\item[1.19] This release of the \textit{CHERI Instruction-Set Architecture
  (ISA) Specification} is an interim version intended for submission to
  DARPA/AFRL to meet the requirements of CTSRD deliverable A015.

  The behavior of \insnref{CToPtr} in the event that the pointer of one
  capability is to the base of the containing capability has been clarified.

  The \cappermASR permission is extended to cover non-CHERI ISA
  privileges, such as use of MIPS TLB-management, interrupt-control,
  exception-handling, and cache-control instructions available in the kernel
  ring.
  The aim of these in-progress changes is to allow the compartmentalization of
  kernel code.

\item[1.20 - UCAM-CL-TR-907] This version of the CHERI ISA, \textit{CHERI
  ISAv6}, has been prepared for publication as University of Cambridge
  technical report UCAM-CL-TR-907.

  Chapter~\ref{chap:introduction} has been substantially reformulated,
  providing brief introductions to both the CHERI protection model and
  CHERI-MIPS ISA, with much remaining content on our research methodology now
  shifted to its own new chapter, Chapter~\ref{chap:research}.
  Our architectural and application-level least-privilege motivations are now
  more clearly described, as well as hybrid aspects of the CHERI approach.
  Throughout, better distinction is made between the CHERI protection model and
  the CHERI-MIPS ISA, which is a specific instantiation of the model with
  respect to 64-bit MIPS.
  The research methodology chapter now provides a discussion of our overall
  approach, more detailed descriptions of various phases of our research and
  development cycle, and describes major transitions in our approach as the
  project proceeded.

  Chapter~\ref{chap:model} on the software-facing CHERI protection model has
  been improved to provide more clear explanations of our approach as well as
  additional illustrations.
  The chapter now more clearly enunciates two guiding principles
  underlying the CHERI ISA design: the \textit{principle of least privilege},
  and the \textit{principle of intentional use}.
  The former has been widely considered in the security literature, and
  motivates privilege reduction in the CHERI ISA.
  The latter has not previously described, and is supports the use of explicitly
  named rights, rather than implicitly selected ones, wherever possible in order
  to avoid `confused deputy' problems.
  Both contribute to vulnerability mitigation effects.
  New sections have been added on revocation and garbage collection.
  The role and implementation of monotonicity (and also non-monotonicity) in
  the ISA are more clearly described.

  A chapter on architectural sketches has been added, describing how the CHERI
  protection model might be introduced in the RISC-V and x86-64 ISAs.
  In doing so, we identify a number of key aspects of the CHERI model that are
  required regardless of the underlying ISA.
  We argue that the CHERI protection model is a \textit{portable} model that can
  be implemented consistently across a broad range of underlying ISAs and
  concrete integrations with those ISAs.
  One implication of this argument is that portable CHERI-aware software can be
  implemented across underlying architectural implementations.

  Chapter~\ref{chap:architecture} now describes, at a high level, CHERI's
  expectations for tagged memory.

  We in general now prefer the phrase ``control-flow robustness'' to
  ``control-flow integrity'' when talking about capability protection for code
  pointers, in order to avoid confusion with conventional CFI.

  The descriptions of software-defined aspects of the \insnnoref{CCall} and
  \insnnoref{CReturn} instructions have been removed from the description and
  pseudocode of each instruction.
  They are instead part of an expanded set of notes on potential software use
  for these instructions.

  A new \insnnoref{CCall} selector 1 has been added that provides a jump-like
  domain transition without use of an architectural exception.
  In this mode of operation, \insnnoref{CCall} unseals the sealed code and
  data capabilities to enter the new domain, offering a different set of 
  hardware and software tradeoffs from the existing selector-0 semantics.
  For example, complex exception-related mechanism is avoided in hardware for
  domain switches, with the potential to substantially improve performance.
  Software would most likely use this mechanism to branch into a trusted
  intermediary capability of supporting safe and controlled switching to a new
  object.

  To support the new \insnnoref{CCall} selector 1, a new permission,
  \emph{Permit\_CCall} is defined authorizing use of the selector on sealed
  capabilities.
  The permission must be present on both sealed code and data capabilities.

  To support the new \insnnoref{CCall} selector 1, a new CP2 exception cause
  code, Permit\_CCall Violation is defined to report a lack of the
  \emph{Permit\_CCall} permission on sealed code or data capabilities passed to
  \insnnoref{CCall}.

  New experimental instructions \insnref{CBuildCap} (import a capability),
  \insnref{CCopyType} (import the \cotype{} field of a capability), and
  \insnref{CCSeal} (conditionally seal a capability) have been added
  to the ISA to be used when re-internalizing capabilities that have been
  written to non-capability-aware memory or storage.
  This instruction is intended to satisfy use cases such as swapping to
  disk, migrating processes, migrating virtual machines, and run-time linking.
  A suitable authorizing capability is required in order to restore the
  tag.
  As these instructions are considered experimental, they are documented in
  Appendix~\ref{app:experimental} rather than the main specification.

  The \insnref{CGetType} instruction now returns $-1$ when used on an
  unsealed capability, in order to allow it to be more easily used with
  \insnref{CCSeal}.

  Two new conditional-move instructions are added to the CHERI-MIPS ISA:
  \insnnoref{CMOVN} (conditionally move capability on non-zero), and
  \insnnoref{CMOVZ} (conditionally move capability on zero).
  These complement existing conditional-move instructions in the 64-bit MIPS
  ISA, allowing more efficient generated code.

  The \insnref{CJR} (capability jump register) and \insnref{CJALR}
  (capability jump and link register) have been changed to accept non-global
  capability jump targets.

  The \insnref{CLC} (capability load capability) and \insnref{CLLC}
  (capability load-linked conditional) instructions will now strip loaded tags,
  rather than throwing an exception, if the Permit\_Load\_Capability permission
  is not present.

  The \insnref{CToPtr} (capability to pointer) instruction now checks that
  the source register is not sealed, and performs comparative range checks of
  the two source capabilities.
  More detailed rationale has been provided for the design of the
  \insnref{CToPtr} instruction in Chapter~\ref{chap:rationale}.

  The pseudocode for the \insnnoref{CCheckType} (capability check
  type) instruction has been corrected to test uperm as well as perm.
  The pseudocode for \insnnoref{CCheckType} has been corrected to test the
  sealed bit on both source capabilities.
  An encoding error for \insnnoref{CCheckType} in the ISA quick reference has
  been corrected.

  The pseudocode for the \insnref{CGetPerm} (capability get permissions)
  instruction has been updated to match syntax used in the
  \insnref{CGetType} and \insnnoref{CGetCause} instructions.

  The pseudocode for the \insnref{CUnseal} (capability unseal) instruction
  has been corrected to avoid an aliasing problem when the source and
  destination register are the same.

  The description of the \insnref{CSeal} (capability seal) instruction has
  been clarified to explain that precision cannot be lost in the case where
  bounds are no longer precisely representable, as an exception will be thrown.

  The description of the fast representability check for compressed capabilities
  has been improved.

  CHERI-related exception handling behavior is now clarified with respect to the
  MIPS EXL status bit, with the aim of ensuring consistent behavior.
  Regardless of bounds set on \KCC{}, a suitable offset is selected so that the
  standard MIPS exception vector will be executed via the exception \PCC{}.

  The section on CHERI control in Chapter~\ref{chap:cheri-mips} has been
  clarified to more specifically identify 64-bit MIPS privileged instructions,
  KSU bits, and general operation modified by the \cappermASR
  permission.
  The section now also more specifically described privileged behaviors not
  controlled by the permission, such as use of specific exception vectors.
  A corresponding rationale section has been added to
  Chapter~\ref{chap:rationale}.

  A number of potential future instruction-set improvements relating to
  capability compression, control flow, and instruction variants with immediates
  have been added to the future ISA changes list in
  Chapter~\ref{chap:architecture}.

  Opcode-space reservations for the previously removed \insnnoref{CIncBase}
  and \insnnoref{CSetLen} instructions have also been removed.

  \creg{25}, which had its hard-coded ISA use removed in CHERI ISAv5, has now
  been made a caller-save capability register in the ABI.

  Citations to further CHERI research publications have been added.

\item[1.21] This release of the \textit{CHERI Instruction-Set Architecture} is
  an interim version intended for submission to DARPA/AFRL to meet the
  requirements of CTSRD deliverable A001, and contains the following changes
  relative to CHERI ISAv6:

  The ISA encoding reference has been updated for new experimental
  instructions.

  A new \insnnoref{CNExEq} instruction has been added, which provides a
  more efficient implementation of a test for negative exact inequality than
  utilizing \insnnoref{CExEq} and inverting the result.

  Specify that when a TLB exception results from attempting to store a
  tagged capability via a TLB entry that does not authorize tagged store, the
  MIPS EntryHi register will be set correspondingly.
